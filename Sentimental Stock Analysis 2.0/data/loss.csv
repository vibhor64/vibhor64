76,2551,Best brokerage for data with dividend stocks?,Discussion,"Not sure if this is the correct forum for a question regarding brokerages instead of stock data.

I am pretty unhappy with my current brokerage's web pages and data.  

1. no ability to individually turn on or off dividend reinvest
2. stocks moved from Roth to normal (not that this happens a lot, but when you're over the limit you're over the limit) show up in the main account as 53,895,345,003% gains since the data of the bought stock that was transferred doesn't come along with it

Ideally, even more analytics as to what dividends are doing would be great.  I don't even know what's out there, but my current brokerage doesn't seem to be doing anything to improve the user interface.  

Like, for example, is there a favored brokerage interface for those who are into the FIRE movement?

My thinking is that Charles Schwabb should be one of the better ones for this since that's their business, but I don't know.",tqavnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tqavnb/best_brokerage_for_data_with_dividend_stocks/,NEGATIVE,0.9999959468841552
31,889,How to Stop Crying - here's your plan.,Discussion,"TL;DR I'm not doing one. I'm typing all this bullshit to help you. You don't want to read it, don't. Go YOLO your shit into Luckin Coffee, you magnificent retard. I love you.

And don't fucking whine about how this is too long. No one cares and I'm tired of this sub being r/whining.

Alright. 

The market is ruining your life. You don't know if we're at bottom or not. But the market is sure you're a bottom and it's coming back to fuck you like a prison inmate again.

Retail investors are plowing money into the market like it's a dime store hooker. Hedge funds are selling off to take their money. Then the stock prices drop, people panic sell. Hedge funds buy all those cheap ass stocks you sold.

So stop that shit. You're making us look bad. 

I mean fuck. You're get raped two ways and then come back for more? Smarten up.

I know. I know. You want tendies. 

Life is hard. You want to stop falling asleep on your couch while the headboard of your bed bangs the wall while your wife's boyfriend puts his no no in her yes yes.

Shut up. Quit crying. Grab some tissues. Listen up.

1. If you have money in the market that you can't live without, take it out. 

This is some basic bitch shit. A volatile market is not the place to invest your rent money. 

No, I don't want you to be responsible. And I don't give a fuck if you're homeless. I want you to not make dumb, emotional, irrational decisions. That's how we all get out of this mess.

If you already fucked this part up, you can shut up and hold for years. Or you can shut up, sell at a massive loss and give up.

If you're leveraged, quit that shit. Paying 8% interest for money that loses 20% is a bad bet. Stop paying brokers and banks to fuck you.

2) Hedge money.

""But but but what the fuck is that? Is it like shrubbing?""

It's cash you keep as cash that you want to invest later or, if you're more into risk, dump some cash into Inverse Etfs (look them up). 

Basically, when the market goes down, they go up. If you use them right, you get to keep your stocks and not take a loss or even make a profit on the ETFs (the jury is still out on if gold is a good hedge or not).

""But but but hedging? But but but inflation. I'll lose money if it sits there.""

Shut up. Inflation is going away. If you invest right you'll make more than inflation will fuck you. And stop buying dumb shit while inflation is high. Don't fuck yourself. You're already getting fucked.

""Now listen here, dinkface. I don't want to hedge. I want to buy the dip. I'm a big bull. My friends and I show each other our big bull balls and swing our dicks at each other to show that we aren't gay bears.""

Shut up. If you want to brag about what kind of animal you are, go to a fucking furry convention. We're here to make money. Money is like your mom. It doesn't care about how big your balls are and it gets me hookers so I can have threesomes with it.

And, shut up, you're still going to buy the dip. But you're going to buy the dip like a man.

What does that mean?

You buy A LITTLE BIT of stocks on the way down (dollar cost averaging, look it up). Buy a LITTLE BIT more every time they have a big dip.

""But but but I don't want to buy a little. I'm a big boy. I buy stocks big. And what if I miss profits? We're already at the bottom.""

Shut up. You're going to make a fuck ton less if you assume we're at the bottom, spend all your cash and then can't buy stocks when they're even cheaper. Anyone who says they know where the bottom is at is a liar or an idiot. I called it wrong once. I'll probably do it again.

If shit turns around (and wait till that is 100% confirmed, retard), the market isn't going up 800% in a day. You can buy more on the way up and still make money as stocks recover.

""But but but what is a little bit of buying, daddy?""

Quit the daddy shit. It's cool when your mom says it to me. It's creepy when you say it.

Here's a basic rule that will keep you from shitting yourself as you watch your portfolio bleed like it's got a perpetual period.

(And it's a basic fucking rule. I don't think this shit is going to happen so don't chirp about it.)

Whatever you're investing amount is overall, assume you'll lose 50% of that. If that makes your ass pucker, use less money. 

Because that's your total budget. Spend it wisely. Spend it in small amounts.

Lots of idiots plowed all their money back into the market in 2000, 2008 when we were nowhere near bottom. Then they sold at bottom. They hate themselves now. Every minute of every day. Some of them are dead. They died with regret.

Don't be an idiot. Yeah, buying something when it's 20% down feels good. You know what feels better? Buying three times as much of that shit when it's 60% down.

3) Pick your stocks in companies that you will be able to hold for 5 years. Maybe you won't have to hold them that long. Maybe you'll have to hold longer. It's a general rule to give you some direction.

The point is if you buy shit that you have to sell before it recovers, you lose. That's not how buying a dip works. You have to buy it and hold it.

""But but but what do I pick?""

Shut up and choose from these options:

A) Companies that have actual value. If you're smart, look up their p/e p/b ratios. General rule, you want something under 25 p/e and 3 p/b. That's a general rule. Some asshole or kind human will probably give a better benchmark in the comments of this post.

You also want a company that isn't carrying a fuckton of debt. Even when the stock market recovers, things are going to get bad in the economy. If companies go bankrupt you'll be wiping your ass with their stocks.

If you're dumb and don't want to learn simple facts like p/e p/b, just pick big ass companies that don't get destroyed when the economy sucks. 

If you want tech, go with Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. Not some fucking IPO you heard about from a guy on the bus who probably touches girls while they're sleeping.

B) Buy companies that pay dividends (Google it, I'm not listing them). They'll pay you money even if the stock shits the bed. You may not make money but you'll lose less until things recover.

C) We're going into a recession. I'm not going to explain it. If you think I'm wrong you're the stupidest of the stupid. You should take your money out of the market, buy a gun and shoot your foot off to remind you to be smarter and read basic economic data.

When people realize we're going into a big recession, they will freak out and probably sell a lot of stocks. Don't do that. Plan for it. Plan to buy or plan to hold. Earliest it will hit is probably summer but people will probably start to lose their shit when Q1 earnings start coming in and they suck donkey cock.

In a recession (especially after this wallet raping inflation) people have less money to spend on things they want because they have to spend money on things they need. So don't invest in companies that sell expensive shit that people don't need.

Think on what people buy when they're broke. They buy shit at Dollar Tree and Costco (DLTR COST) They buy food at grocery stores (look up the tickers yourself - not high end grocery stores). They buy fast food instead of eating dinner out (MCD). They buy coke products (I mean the drink - KO). They watch shit on tv (pick a streamer). They still buy alcohol and cigarettes (look them up, I don't buy that shit because I'm ethical as fuck and don't invest in it). Consumer staples like toilet paper and toothpaste (PG JNG). And people still get sick and have to see doctors (UHG).

Buy companies that do well in a recession. 

Banks do well in recessions. Banks do well when interest rates are going up (which they are in a big way). Both are happening.

Just know that China's economy is fucked and Russia's economy just got nuked which affected banks all over the world. You might want to see how that global shit works out before you invest in them. Wells Fargo has increased 30% short interest right now (only 1% but still a spike). That's for a reason.

""But but but my dad buys that stable big value company stocks. I want to buy cool stocks like laser guided robotic cat dildos because I'm awesome. I'm smart, edgy and cool.""

Shut up. You're not. And I'll still let you buy those stocks. Just buy less of those and buy the good ones that have actual revenue on the horizon. Research. Like your dad, it's not hard (which is why your mom left him for me).

If you're really fucking smart, you buy a little with the plan to hold. Then, if a bunch or retards pump up a stock 30% based on nothing, sell that shit, wait for it to tank and rebuy.

""But but but HODL! BUY ALL THE DIPS!!!""

Ok. That's fine by me. You're the reason I've made fat cash off of UPST, PLTR, gold and silver (and then rebought them). You're why I made a shitton off of meme stocks last year. Thanks for that.

""But but but what about other investments that I can't talk about here because of this sub's rules?""

I'll be honest, I don't know how that stuff is going to shake out. I am sure that if you invest in a volatile asset and think it's a hedge you're so stupid it hurts your ancestors.

Yeah, it might be a hedge. But no one has proven that. Investment patterns don't support that idea being true. When the NASDAQ is down 20% it isn't a good time to experiment with a new hedge. Don't be the guy who base jumps with a parachute that didn't come with instructions.

Alright. That's it. Now shut up and get back out there. No more whining.

Redfin wanted to add rentals fast instead of building it from scratch. But the price and the way it paid for RentPath is the reason why I wouldn't invest in Redfin. They don't make good decisions.

Redfin purchased RentPath in an all-cash deal for $608m on Feb 19 when its stock price was $96, an all-time high.  Instead of trying to purchase RentPath with stocks or a combination of stock/cash, it did by using 1/3 of its total cash on hand. Redfin literally bought a real estate company with cash at the **exact peak** of the real estate stock bubble.

At $608m, it was 6% of Redfin's market cap on Feb 19.  Today, Redfin's stock price is $15.73 and has a market cap of 1.67B. This means the price paid for **RentPath is now 39% of Redfin's total market cap**.

RentPath was a company in bankruptcy.

Total insanity.

Now Redfin only has $750m in cash instead of $1.35b while they lost $100m in 2021. We're heading into a prolonged bear real estate market due to rising interest rates.

Baba has fallen by 30% within a week and the end seems not in sight. Even the almighty Tencent was not spared from this perfect storm.

The reasons for their drop could be from the possible implications of delisting from the US, China’s regulatory claw and the more likely cause which is similar sanctions imposed on Russia slapped on the Chinese companies.

Would the US and its allies impose drastic sanctions on China? Based on a realistic assessment, it is unlikely to happen as China is playing the neutral role well so far. However, it was also unlikely too for Russia to wage a war on Ukraine without negotiations so it is anyone’s guess in this crazy world.

48,1539,"Despite the political conflicts, stock prices go up. Should it make any sense?",Discussion,"Hello everybody!

&#x200B;

At the moment, we all witness the political conflict in Eastern Europe and how the world reacts to it. But, I created this sub not to discuss politics. Actually, I wonder how it will affect the stock market in the future?

&#x200B;

Basically, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine started, the whole world implemented economic sanctions against Russia. It's a fact. Another important moment that some giant international corporations, such as Apple, Microsoft, and this list I can continue for too long, decided to close their stores and online stores and fire all employees. Even companies, such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola, known globally, have decided to leave the Russian market. Many of them say it's not permanent. But, who knows?

&#x200B;

On the one hand, it's some way of punishing Russians by leaving them without some favorite goods. They are left without luxury goods and some basic necessities provided by the companies such as Procter and Gamble. Well, I hope they received the message that they have to do something.

&#x200B;

But, on the other hand, those companies are also losing their customers. Indeed, Russia is huge. It's not something like those companies looking at North Korea, but who cares? Shouldn't those actions affect the stock market too? As I understand it, those companies lose a significant profit share. So, their stock prices should go down.

&#x200B;

I expected to catch this moment with low stock prices and start investing in stocks. But, I was really shocked when I saw that stock prices, for some reason, are going up. Not all of them, but Apple's shares definitely went up. I was trying to find some logic in this, but I just can't catch on to how it's even possible. I've tried to find some explanation on sources, such as [https://investorjunkie.com/](https://investorjunkie.com/), where everything is explained in pretty much simpler terms. Still, I don't get it.

Also assume that one already has other plays like value, oil, etc.  e.g. I am not asking if these stocks are overpriced and if we should instead buy CVX or HAL, etc.

NVDA has AI, which appears to still be at an early stage and has unrealized potential.  However, it is unclear how much of that potential is real and how much is hype.  If we get a bear market, NVDA will drop but might come back once the AI potential is realized, especially if the AI is needed for the event triggering the bear market (e.g. making smart weapons to combat Russia, accelerating green technologies to combat climate change, etc.).

GOOGL also has AI and some other plays like Waymo, but GOOGL remains mostly advertising.  If we do get a recession or a bear market, GOOGL could get hit hard and might also be slower to recover.

MSFT seems the most stable of the three, but I'm not sure if the growth will be as high going forward.

Bears are screaming that rates are going to go through the roof because INFLATION!! The premise is understandable BUT it is basically impossible to do so.

In 1980 when Volcker raised rates by 20% to fight high inflation, our national debt was at $908 billion ($3 trillion today if adjusted for inflation) and it was 30% of the national GDP so raising rates was still affordable.

Today, when we are running at $30 trillion of debt with $23 trillion of GDP or 139% ratio, raising rates to levels anywhere near Volcker's levels is simply impossible - the country will go tits up the same day. We simply will not be able to service our debt at high rates

8,253,GME strategy. Exercising calls and strategically buying OTM puts and calls literally can’t go tits up.,Discussion,"I see 3 possible outcomes tomorrow. It’s simple. I’ll explain my theories and tell you how to make money off the possible outcomes. 

As you all know there are a ton of call options that are ITM that weren’t supposed to be ITM this week. I don’t know about you but I don’t see this price action stopping this week so I’m actually going to exercise a few 100 strikes. I doubt I’m the only one because this baby is going to the moon.  

WS is probably going to bring this heat tomorrow more ways than one but here’s how to how you make money and apply buying pressure. 

It’s actually hilarious because I think their only way out is to cheat. 

Most likely scenario: I see an iv crush in the AM with no gap down to deter swing traders from buying in. This slow uptrend isn’t working for them today. Apes must have learned patience last year. There will be a de-hedging scenario in which market makers sell their shares (that they never bought…yet) because people with take profits on calls and not everyone has enough money to exercise them. It’s inevitable. This doesn’t change the fact that more calls will be bought but they will get people to paper hand. 

How do you solve this? Clearly you buy OTM puts at the open to hedge your bullish position. This way market makers lose both ways, and the only other solution for them is to cover short positions, pay up on the puts or calls, or get dirty. Long story short…If they need it down then make them pay you for it. It’s ok if you lose money on puts i literally was up 70% on my long calls today and down 80% on my puts. I made no money but I’m prepared and I didn’t lose money. 

Best case scenario: as soon as think they won. Someone or institution buys a crap ton of shares, creating fomo again, retail starts buying more calls…WS panics and the road to ATH begins after hours.


Worst case scenario: some fed propaganda comes out tanks the whole market and and Gme of course goes down with it on some illegal dark pool derivative Wall Street stuff (I mean, does it really matter right now?) guess what you bought puts and make more money then you would have on calls. 

I’m not talking about 0 day options here, at least 1-2 weeks out. I got 20 130 puts for 4/1 and and 60 250 call strikes for 4/14. 

Also is it just me or is the We3d stock shit come back just on time - same as last year. Do you, but I don’t give a shit. Stay focused. You know what’s happening and you know the truth. 

TLDR: hedge OTM puts. Exercise calls. Hold. This is how normal folk can help. It’s actually more effective than buying shares rn since settlement takes 2 days but of course buy and hold. 

This is not financial head lice 🫠

Edit morning update: As of market open…It appears I should have just bought all calls. I still believe puts close the money still help keep the price up short term.

Edit 2: 11:20am. Scenario 3 literally happened. Shaved off some Gme call profits when I saw the fed was going to speak and figured if I were them it would be a good time to tank the market. That’s another reason I believe the Gme squeeze is the real deal. Bought some SPY 0DTE before 11am in case Gme just kept going up. It was good timing 50x445 spy p 0DTE quick 3x - fuck em.

12,353,Can We Talk About How Greasy This Whole AMC Deal Is? It's Comical,Discussion,"Alright, retard, all opinions on memestocks and AMC squeeze shenanigans out the window for this post and comment section.🤝

We will focus on this AMC gold miner deformed dumpster baby that literally gets sketchier the deeper you really look.

But first, how greasy is this deal? [Greasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7FsAgPuVwU)

Let us dive in:

1st: Let me take this layup real quick, movie theatre executives don't know dick on how to fucking mine for natural precious metals. Coincidentally, this is about as close as a YOLO a corporate executive/board can go.

2nd: HYMC coincidentally drops an ATM stock offering this morning of up to 500 million unloading on apes as the stocks price launches. For those who don't understand, they are essentially able to soak up this 500% share price increase in taking a shitload of cash while massively diluting their shares. Isn't it odd that this was left out of the AMC press release and not spoken about at all on MSM today? Personally, I read an article in Barrons and NYT that completely failed to even mention it once. Side note: in a total dipshit move that makes Cramer look normal aaron [canceled](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1503763167473713155?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) his appearance on CNBC with a dumbass reply, what a fucking dweeb. Everyone knows in the era of Elon Musk, laws and court orders don't matter on Twitter and TV.

3rd: Goldminers largest shareholder is Mudrick Capital \~40% of stock outstanding. For you true autists, this is the same Mudrick Capital who bought 8.1 million shares of AMC stock in a closed offering and then sold the very same day. Wow, ain't that fucking weird. 

4th: The movements of this stock before this announcement are fucking sketch as hell. Take a look at 2.50 strike [call](https://imgur.com/a/62YCIqU) open interest. So you telling me that some entity just decided to yolo massive amounts of money on massive OTM calls days till expiry on some shit profitless mining company right before a fucking movie theatre buys a massive stake? Call me sherlock holmes cause that's suspicious. 

\-Granted, most of the volume for these options came in Friday at prices between .15 and .60 and the options barely got above .30. Nonetheless, sketch as hell. But the general movements of the stock before the announcement is undeniable.

4.5: This one isn't of any substance but I think it's worth something. This fucker took a picture with a sign in the middle of the desert as a showing of quality, no gold production or busty facilities. This is essentially if Elon Musk came out to woo his retarded investors with a new car model and instead of showing an actual car he shows a drawing.

22,662,South Park Investment Theory (deeper dive),Discussion,"Ten months ago, u/robertisaak proposed, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naehn4/south_park_investment_theory/) on wsb, using a portfolio derived from South Park episodes. He promised to return with a graph but never did. I took it upon myself to continue his research. 

While the show definitely had its tenbaggers, I assumed that the good calls on Build A Bear Workshop, Tesla ($TSLA), Apple ($AAPL), Sony ($SONY), Amazon ($AMZN) were just lucky, and, all-in-all, the performance should be roughly on par with an index (let's say S&P500, as it uses the same acronym). 

I did however decide to look deeper into it, and to my surprise, a very simple South Park Index^[1] drastically outperforms S&P.

This is how they actually compare:  [2009-2022 graph 🚀🚀🚀](https://i.imgur.com/VhUObvd.jpg). 

A different comparison showing how good our South Park predictions are is the following: consider you buy a stock mentioned in an episode during that day and keep it for a month, respectively a year - how does the performance compare to buying $SPY on that day? Average returns:

* **1 month hold**: South Park Stock: 5.93% 🚀 vs S&P 0.93%
* **1 year hold**: South Park Stock: 35.42% 🚀 vs S&P 11.86%

While past performance doesn't guarantee future performance and this approach has some small biases^[2], the numbers make it quite clear that South Park has been a really good stock selector. But why is that? You could argue that the publicity that it brought helped, but it's definitely too small of an impact for the large-cap stocks (i.e. AAPL, AMZN). Most likely it's just the fact that the episodes tend to focus on things disrupting & impacting our society, those things that change the way we do things ($TSLA, $AAPL, $TWTR), those we love ($SONY) and those we hate ($AMZN). Buying such companies at an early time is a good way to make a strong return (especially in a long Bull Market).

So, should you buy the next stock mentioned? Maybe, probably. 
!!This is not financial advice!!

[Bank of America](https://www.thetimesoftruth.com/bear-market-rally-warning-this-inventory-surge-is-a-bear-market-lure-warns-bofa/) is now warning that the 'Bear Market rally', otherwise known as a short-term Fibonacci retracement in the upwards direction of a macro downtrend, is done.  Therefore, they're calling for a continued de-risking of equities and risk-on assets.  Based on my independent analysis above, I am in agreeance with BofA.

Too, the London Metal Exchange (LME), as backed by J.P. Morgan, bailed out their short-seller(s) at the expense of everyone else.  In a way that you would only wish that I was making up, the LME just 'undid' days of trades, made by smart investors who beat the 'short-selling tycoons' of the nickel markets.  This type of care-free destruction of public trust in markets could very well spread to the U.S., where investors are already skeptical about the Fed's correlations with short-selling bad actors in the market who are actively being investigated by the DOJ.  As we can see daily, the Fed's reverse repo 'overnight' program has been exploited on the order of $2 Trillion - this is in combination with a $10 Trillion Fed balance sheet, new requests for $6 Trillion budgets, and the [$4.5 Trillion Fed private 2019 bailout of Wall Street banks behind the backs of American taxpayers](https://tokenist.com/fed-finally-identifies-banks-received-4-5t-q4-2019-repo-program/).

Further, it was shown that [Barclays was just fined](https://www.ft.com/content/386df3ee-4b9d-45c5-9ae1-d5dffb2a822e) for half a Billion USD for over-shorting VXX which is an ETN that is associated with volatility and S&P 500 futures.  They literally short-sold 15 Billion USD of this volatility ETN BEYOND their $20 Billion limit as required by the U.S. - thereby creating false 'stability' pressures (yes: using wide-scale short-selling phenomena to subdue an important volatility ETN that is connected to the entire market system via S&P 500 contracts, options and futures) thereby inducing *fake* macro market stability during a time of geopolitical conflict, in order to put on a front of western market stability... in a way that simply did not make sense to economists.  Now, they have several weeks to months to *buy back all of these shares (thereby going long in volatility ETNs with tens of billions of dollars)*, or face blacklisting from U.S. regulators.  Similar in a few ways to the 'short-vol' XIV scandal in 2018, but in this case 'long vol,' this will surely add to the volatility in markets going forward.  That was owned by Credit Suisse.  That blew up.  That no longer exists.  Will the VXX ETN 'survive' in this process?  You can count on it that there is a line or two [in the 285 page prospectus](https://ipathetn.barclays/ipath/details/341408/download-content/7726665) that will probably lead to a 'no' answer.  Nevertheless, every investment associated with that will be Sayanora.  With the \^VIX having fallen in-a-perfectly-straight-line from 39 to 19 line over three weeks \[*and now we know why*\]:  I am now 'bullish', or perhaps even 'apish', on volatility.

49,1905,"Whilst Tesla continues to be priced for domination of automotive markets globally, it's EV mkt share continues to fall",Discussion,"Tesla""s mkts share of global EV sales was 17% in 2019.  In 2021 it was 14%.  It remains a trillion dollar company whilst VW Group, for example, has a $111 billion mkt cap and BYD only a $102 billion mkt cap, despite outselling Tesla in EV's in the world's largest EV mkts.

Just published figures from insideevs.com, show Tesla continues to lose mkt share in the two largest global EV mkts.

Tesla has fallen to 9th place with a 5.4% mkt share in Europe (YTD 2022), the second largest EV mkt in the world, but the most mature with 20% of car sales now EV's.  Volkswagen group by comparison holds an 18.7% share of the EV mkt - let alone the millions of ICE vehicles it sells:

https://insideevs.com/news/576496/europe-plugin-car-sales-february2022/

(Tesla does have an end of quarter push that should raise its mkt share a little)

In China Tesla was surpassed by BYD last year, pushing it into third place.  It remains so with a lowly 6.4% of mkt share YTD:

https://insideevs.com/news/576396/china-plugin-car-sales-february2022

Whilst Tesla Model Y sales have risen, Model 3 sales have fallen out of the top 10 sales, and no surprise with the BYD Han and XPeng P7 superior BEV's for less money.

BYD has sold a whopping 185K EV's already in China this year vs Tesla's 43K.  So many investors dismiss BYD as insignificant (and weirdly as a scooter manufacturer for some reason). Whilst Tesla still talks about a semi, BYD is selling fully electric trucks in the USA, to little fanfare:

https://en.byd.com/truck/ 

Globally they, as others, are already selling electric buses, refuse trucks, coaches, etc.  Tesla may just catch BYD this quarter with an end of qtr push, but BYD should surpass Tesla in total EV's sold this year. Let's just ponder that.  In 2022 Tesla will no longer be the biggest EV company by global sales, yet is priced 10 times the value of the company that will outsell it.

Whilst Tesla investors will shout about tech and self drive, they still don't sell any business to business automotive tech (unlike NVIDIA, INTEL etc).  Whilst the media focuses on Tesla's arduous, and dangerously publicly tested, push to full self drive, companies like Baidu are already offering fully automated robo-taxis in eight cities and doubling revenue therein every quarter:

16,459,"Why inflation is about to get out of control, and no amount or rate raising Is going to stop it.",Discussion,"Good morning. 
This is just starting to get picked up by the media, but I don't believe anyone has realized the scale of what's about to happen. 

You've seen sanctions take a toll on gas prices, and this has already brought you more inflation on top of your post pandemic inflation. This was just the beginning. Now it's time for your pocketbooks to hurt. 

Russia and Ukraine are two of the world's biggest exporters of grain. Russian has banned grain exports, and as for Ukraine, it's hard as fuck to grow that shit when tanks are rolling through your fields and you gotta use your tractor to steal em, instead of planting. How do you play this? Well if you are in Africa you better stock up on food because you are about to have none. Turns out African countries and countries like Lebanon are the biggest importers of Ukrainian and Russian grains. Expect to see massive famine in these parts of the world. 

Ok, but what do I care? I'm not poor! Well here is some bad news. Grain scarcity is gonna drive up your food prices. Expect even more inflation in the grocery stores. 

Ok so no big deal, let's increase production in other countries. Well that's easier said than done. Food production required significant inputs. Those tractors need deisel. Those prices are already skyrocketed. You need food to feed livestock. Corn and other commodities have skyrocketed. Oh and one last thing. You need fertilizer. Who is the world's largest exporters of fertilizer you ask? Well, guess what. It's Russia. They've banned exports. Ok well let's get fertilizer from somewhere else! Who is another major exporter? Belarus. Also banned exports. Well let's buy from YARA, one of Europes biggest producers! Well no, there cut production due to skyrocketing natural gas prices. Well let's increase our output of natural gas. Well no, Europe's destroyed all that infrastructure ( thanks to Russian funded lobbiests and environmental groups). 
So with skyrocketing costs of fertilizer, and grain, and gas, we are fucked. Expect mass starvation in Latin America ( Brazil is largest importer of Russian fertilizer) and Africa. Expect prices to skyrocket in Europe and in north America. 
Expect massive rate hikes to control inflation ( won't help) 


My time frame: 90 days. 
My inflation estimate, 12-20%

So can we do anything to solve this? 
No. It's too late to do anything. Planting is already happening and many farmers are choosing not to due to high prices. Even if sanctions are lifted tomorrow, fertilizer doesn't just magically appear in Brazil from Russia. Grain doesn't just magically make its way to Africa. So far we have done nothing to increase our food production to account for this. Why 90 days? The world Operates on a 90 day supply of food. If we stop producing today, that's all we have left. 90 days. Expect by July to see massive price increases. 

How do you play this? 
I don't know, that's why it's a discussion not DD. 
Spy doesn't seem to have this priced in. 
GM puts may be a good option (rate raises, plus high gas prices, plus gm is not well positioned for hybrid/ electric)

121,1318,"Bank of America: Market sell-off is overdone, Nvidia (NVDA) ""buy"" rating, NVDA will rise?",Company Discussion,"Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a research report that Nvidia ([NVDA](https://NVDA.US)) shares have been sold off recently due to concerns about slowing growth, but the sell-off appears to be overdone.

Arya said Nvidia shares fell sharply last week, likely due to concerns about its gaming business, which has also sent the stock down 26% so far this year. Arya speculates that market concerns may stem from the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict that may dampen demand for European customers, Chinese customers may be affected by the epidemic blockade measures, and cryptocurrency-related customers may be affected by the falling price of Ethereum and the POS consensus mechanism (representing Ethereum Blockchain security will transition from expensive power-hungry mining hardware to relying on staking tokens) resulting in reduced demand for graphics cards.

""While we point to these headwinds, we believe investors may be underestimating other supporting trends, including: strength in data centers, the Pro Viz platform and the automotive business in the second half,"" the analyst added, based on Hopper-structured gaming products and inventory replenishment will also boost the stock.

Arya pointed out that if Nvidia's gaming business were to decline, it would only have a 7%-9% impact on earnings per share. The analyst lays out a scenario for this, expecting Nvidia’s earnings per share to decline by 5% sequentially in the current quarter and 10% in the next quarter. ""It's worth noting that Nvidia's gaming business sales grow by an average of 25% every two years (a CAGR of 8% to 45%), while the above scenario assumes a two-year CAGR of only 25%,"" Arya wrote. 6%, well below the historical range.""

In the end, Arya concluded: ""Considering that Nvidia is increasing sales in the high barrier computing market at a CAGR of 20-25% (3 times the growth of the semiconductor industry) in the high barrier computing market, while maintaining more than 45% Industry-leading EBIT and we continue to view Nvidia as one of the most important growth companies in the semiconductor space, even in technology.” Currently, the analyst has a “buy” rating on Nvidia with a price target of 375 Dollar.",u2bcv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u2bcv7/bank_of_america_market_selloff_is_overdone_nvidia/,NEGATIVE,0.9999021291732788
174,1488,Upcoming Merger between Discovery & Warner bros DD,Company Analysis,"Hello r/stocks community members,

I want to pitch you guys with an investment opportunity. But please remember to do your own due diligence. Let me know if I've gotten anything wrong. I want to avoid providing a biased pitch, so I'd shy from giving my assumptions.

Ok, here we go.

* Discovery is merging with Warner bros, which is set to close Q2 2022. We don't know the date, but has already obtained all anti-trust and regulatory authority approvals.
* Discovery Warner bro joint company is set to generate $52bn revenue on pro forma basis, which puts it the number #1 streaming platform compared to $NFLX & $DIS.
* Discovery is a profitable yet boring company. Sure, many of you have come across very profitable companies with declining future profitability prospects therefore depressed valuations e.g., Altria, KHC, KO, etc.
* Discovery generates approximately $2bn in free cash flow at $14bn valuation. Growing revenue and cost at GDP and work backward on a DCF model, market implied perpetual growth rate is only -1%. Yes, the market is pricing the company in steady decline for -1% every year despite the company generated 14% top line improvement last year.
* Discovery and Warner bros merger will create the deepest library content for streaming platform in the market. Management already said the joint company will join their streaming application into one, meaning combining IPs such as Suicide Squad, Peace maker, Food channel, etc.
* Discovery is also one of the very few streaming platform offering sports entertainment including NHL, NCAA, Olympics, etc.
* Qualitative aside. Let's talk valuations. The company is currently trading 1x 2023 forward EV/Sales compared to 2.5x $DIS and 4.5x $NFLX.
* A slight multiple re-rate to 2x on pro forma basis already brings your investment 2x at today's valuation. I know I said no assumptions for me, but if I have to give my target, I have a rule of thumb for top contender trading 75% of market leader multiple, so that's roughly 3.3x. Or if worst case scenario, if it just trades close but lower to $DIS, you still get over 100% return on the investment. This is one of the least followed company on Fitwit and I believe there are some mispricing remains.
* Two reasons why the mis-pricing exist today. 1) there's still no set date on merger schedule despite approvals have been obtained from regulatory body and the board. 2) Discovery has yet to provide on post merger share translation information. There's a very informative article on Seeking alpha by Livy research that gives an estimate on a likely scenario on shares translation on the joint company. I will refrain from providing link because there's a rule against seeking alpha on reddit (I think?).

Let me know if I'm missing anything guys. I've been following event driven opportunities for sometime, and this is one of the wildest underprice pre merger opportunity just yet.

Thank you all for reading. Let me know your thoughts in the comments, and happy trading. Thanks.",tmmc4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tmmc4y/upcoming_merger_between_discovery_warner_bros_dd/,NEGATIVE,0.9998977184295654
112,2564,Why does Intel Stock drop after earnings?,Technical Analysis,"I bought in with Intel ( INTC ) when it was 44 dollars. I bought 100 shares outright, and also bought about 9 long calls 50 strike, expiry is in May , which is after April 28th.. I was going to keep my contracts to see if it shot up more at earnings, but looking at Intel historically, most of the time they drop pretty hard right after earnings.. And its not always because of bad earnings reports.  I have to go all the way back to jan of 2020 ( unless I missed one) to see where Intel actually went up after earnings.

I know we shoudl have our exit strategies, so mine is definitely going to be before earnings. I thought maybe they had a chance to shoot up some more after earnings because Nvidia and Intel doing a deal together.  Its been a nice ride so far, that is for sure, but I need to start thinking about my exit again. I had one set already, it surpassed it. I am not trying to be greedy, but I want to optimize the gain as much as I can before pulling the plug.

Anyone else deal with Intel and see this drop after earnings?

97,3000,Russian ADR/GDR securities - can I buy/sell them directly and not through exchange?,Discussion,"Hello community,

&#x200B;

As you probably know, since March 1st, all Russian GDR/ADR securities have been suspended from trading all over the world stock exchanges.

So nobody can buy/sell them (some brokers allow only-close actions, but due to lack of buyers - the prices are near zero).

As per the recent Russian govenment's law - all Russian GDR/ADR securities has to be cancelled: all the receits owners will receive the stocks/shares instead of their GDR/ADR securities.  
However, for non-russian resedents it's not an easy procedure: it's not clear how they will receive the shares/stocks if they do not have an account with a russian broker.

I know some traders would like to get rid of russian securities but have no chance to sell them on decent price (current prices at LSE near zero).  


Is there a way that an owner of Russian GDR/ADR may sell it to another person (p2p transaction) ?

5,170,Housing isn't coming down. Ever.,Discussion,"So tired of reading the endless copium on housing. I get it. Many of you can't afford homes, that doesn't mean prices are coming down anytime soon.

Despite everything you've heard to the contrary, most houses are owned by people. I know I know: CoRPoraTiOnS ARe buYIng aLL tHe HoMEs!! But it's just not true. For single family rented homes only 300,000 are owned by corporations while 16.2 million are owned by ""mom and pop"" landlords.

To understand how significant this is we need to look at what has recently occurred with mortgage rates. First lets just overview the 30y fixed that's offered to US consumers. This is an incredible deal that doesn't really exist anywhere else in the world. The reason is fairly obvious, it's just a bad deal for the lender. It's a deeply asymmetric trade; if rates go up you get a better deal than before in relative terms, if rates go down you get to refinance at the lower rate.

And that's exactly what happened! Covid struck and all of a sudden people had the chance to refinance bellow 3%, and not just for owner occupied units but rentals too. Every property owner with half a brain took advantage of this.

Fast forward to today and rates are at 4.8%. It might not seem like a big deal, after all rates fluctuate. 1.8% give or take isn't really that big of a deal right? WRONG!

It's a huge deal. We've never pushed rates so low and guaranteed them for so long. Rates need to be viewed on a relative basis. That means paying 4.8% interest is 60% more than 3% with regards to debt maintenance. No one with half a brain is ever going to sell a home they refinanced under 3%. Let that sink in.

Government covid policy has effectively removed a very large percentage of homes from the available market permanently. There will likely never be a time in the future in which selling one of these refinanced single family rentals is a good play. Moreover, the 60 million or so single family owner occupied homes are highly incentivized to never move or if they do turn they're existing home into a rental.

The logical way this plays out does not look good for inventories. People who's financial situation has stayed about the same are extremely unlikely to move. People who's finances have deteriorated are incentivized to hold on for dear life or face significantly worse living conditions, and people who's financial situation has drastically improved are much more likely to rent their old place out and can afford to do so.

Inventories are fukt. And not just right now, but for decades.

All of this has already happened. You can literally watch its effects playing out in the market right now. Looking at market conditions it seems like things are going to get much worse before they get better.

Obviously inflation is the elephant in the room, and the US govt is not well positioned to deal with it. If inflation is permitted to run wild housing will get a huge boost. Most houses are fractionally owned with most money coming from the govt as they are ultimately the primary lender this relationship will mean homeowners are making several times the inflation rate just from holding real property.

Conversely, govt tackles inflation head on (LOL) by raising rates. This will make the those 3% loans too good to give up. Mortgage rates at even 6% will mean you are paying twice as much servicing your debt at those who bought at 3%. 6% is still bellow the current inflation rate, how likely is it for them to ever get inflation bellow 3% without cheating on their CPI.

So, we have an extremely constrained supply that is structurally unable to improve. The only available option is new housing. New housing starts data has been bad for years, and while the numbers have improved lately they 1. Aren't enough,  2. Coming on the back of a major materials/commodities re-pricing and 3. Struggling with labor costs and supply so widespread many laborers are able to choose safer/easier work. Best case (for non-homeowners) is we continue to build at an elevated pace and stop the trend, but this will take years not months.

So before you even get started, no this is nothing like 2008. In 08 people were signing up for horrible variable rate mortgages designed to fuck them, now they've signed up for a bunch of 30y fixed at under 3% designed to stimulate the economy at the expense of the future. So here we are in the future, paying for all those 3% 30y the govt bought up like hotcakes. Even if, as many of you housing bears insist, housing prices come down it will almost certainly be on the back of meaningfully higher lending rates. This will NOT create housing supply since most mortgages are around 3%, unlike 2008 when they were twice that! If interest rates hit 6% and prices drop 40% (they won't) it still wouldn't create the waves of defaults we saw in 2009.

TLDR: Housing operates like all markets, based on supply and demand. There will always be demand but supply will never really come back thanks to ultra loose monetary policy during covid and the govts willingness to buy up all the 30Y mortgage paper. The only way supply constraints can lessen is if asset price inflation is tamed AND rates are close to 3%, so basically never.

Positions: Short 1.2M in mortgage bonds at 2.99% secured by apartments and houses.

Edit: Purpose of this post isn't that housing is cheap and should be bought at these prices, it's that supply has been structurally constrained and this effect is likely permanent.

118,1153,AAPL is now less than 5% off of its highs,Company Discussion,"I guess I'm just interested in hearing from those who are bullish on AAPL at its current price, because I find this hard to understand.

AAPL is now trading a 29 PE which is really high given they're growing slower than the other mega cap tech names, and until very recently would trade with a PE in the mid teens. On the other hand AAPL has a solid balance sheet and they continue to return profits to shareholders via buybacks. I can understand why investors might want to own a company like AAPL given the economic uncertainties, but I'm not sure it's worth a 29 PE multiple. It looks like a stock that should trade with a PE multiple in the low 20s to me.

A lot has changed since AAPL last traded at this level. To name a few: RU invaded UA. The 10 year yield is almost percentage point higher. Europe looks likely to enter recession. Gas prices and other commodity prices have spiked higher. Inflation appears to be more persistant than originally thought. And the FED will likely need to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated.

Given economic conditions have deteriorated since, what's the reasoning for AAPL to be trading near ATHs again?

If someone could help me out by answer the following questions or giving their perspective, I’d greatly appreciate it.

(1) Why would you pick $LOW over $HD?

56,2194,Paypal Founder calling out Buffett and the Gerontocracy,Discussion,"Lest anyone dares to call the finance section boring, billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel (of PayPal, Palantir and Facebook fame) took shots at fellow billionaires at a bitcoin conference in Miami yesterday.

**Them's Fighting Words**

Throwing hundred dollar bills at the crowd, Thiel hailed bitcoin as a youthful “movement, and it’s a political question whether this movement is going to succeed, or whether the enemies of the movement will succeed in stopping us.” Then he proceeded to call Warren Buffett the “sociopathic grandpa from Omaha” and ""enemy number one,"" along with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink the “gerontocracy” against the cryptocurrency revolution. According to Thiel, these large institutional investors ""need to be allocating some of their money to bitcoin,"" and they are holding it back.

**Pick a side**

Which side are you and your money on? On one side, Berkshire Hathaway did dismiss bitcoin as ""rat poison"" and may have missed out on incredible gains. On the other, are eternal cheerleaders like Block and Twitter founder, Jack Dorsey, who says crypto “changes everything” for him and “I don't think there's anything more important in my lifetime to work on, and I don't think there's anything more enabling for people around the world.”

For the rest of us plebs, most only recently considered investing in cryptocurrency and cannot afford to buy into bitcoin now.

**The conservative middle road?**

Berkshire ended up investing in NuBank, a popular online bank for crypto investors. If crypto feels too risky, but you also don't want to just wait and see, take a page from the Buffett playbook and look at services growing around cryptocurrency.

For example, Silvergate Bank is positioning itself to be the leading blockchain bank providing crucial behind-the-scenes services to cryptocurrency investors. It also has plans to be able to convert fiat into crypto in the future.

109,2274,4-7-22 SPY/ Apple Daily TA,Technical Analysis,"Going into today we had a small gap of about 90 cents to fill left on the daily chart. While GAPs almost always fill an upside gap when we are in what appears to be a short term bear trend can be up for debate as there is no real timeframe for gaps to fill. It does appear SPY fills them two days later usually. 

With that being said we saw the bears take hold again today running the VIX back up to 23.82 intraday and a low of 443.53 before saw a massive (what used to be rare but is now common) mid day reversal of trend. While these trends are getting pretty darn old they are becoming fairly common. Again the hint was the back to back massive red candles at 1pm. From there she just kept falling. That 24 level seems to be key “resistance” right now.

As you can see we are within a clear downward what I call a double channel. We are currently trading within and bouncing upward resistance of the upper channel. 

Despite the big energy the bulls came with end of day we saw SPY stop dead in its tracks at 450.5 range and failed to break through that resistance for over an hour before it finally sold off right into candle with a nice fat red candle down to 448.77. 

With the gap being filled and the upper limit holding strong I will be watching for a sell off into after hours and for futures to take a small dip over night. I suspect we could trade around the 446.5 to 44 range after hours. 

Upper resistance for the channel (assuming we stay with in it overnight) puts resistance at 449.5 for open and support at 445.7 à 442 à 438.

While I am watching for a bearish formation (see the black channel down) I am monitoring for SPY to find support and continue on a bull run (red channel) of course while also monitoring for a bigger overall channel that I have not been able to establish yet. 

If the BEAR channel holds true tomorrows range is 442.3 to 455.5.  
 If the BULL channel holds true 445.5 to 460 is tomorrows range. 

The one thing while this chart is very busy I want to point out is the EMAs. Today we saw SPY dip below the 20, 50, and 100 daily EMAs for the 2nd time this week but failed to close below it again. On the upside we rejected quite firmly at the daily 8ema of 450.8. To me the breaking of the 20, 50 and 100 ema AGAIN along with the very firm rejection and red candle into close tonight is bearish for tomorrow and definitely for next week. We also finally have a true downward direction on the daily 8ema. 

Now of course if tomorrow bulls can get this up and over the daily 8ema and close above it I would think 460 comes before 440. However, I will be looking for bears to get back on track again tomorrow and close below the daily 50 ema at 445.3. However, a close below the 100ema at 446.75 or the daily 20 ema at 447.21 would also be a bearish indication for next week. 

We also have a confirmed daily MACD sell and RSI still a 53 trending sideways now.

Same thing with the weekly chart here the bears were able to get it down below the weekly 20 and 8ema which is very bearish and I will look for them to close this candle tomorrow below the 20 and 8ema at 445.38/ 446.64. A close there with a firmly red candle below the doji last week would solidify some red downside next week in my opinion.

The VIX has another MASSIVE day today with a total range from peaks to lows of 21.12 to 23.82 or a move of 12% again today. Some very big moves this week with the VIX that’s for sure. 

Before someone says “YoU cAnT tA tHe ViX” Yes I know this… duh… BUT you can watch key levels and right now this month the low has been 18.7 and the high 24.8. What the means to me is closing at 21.56 we are pretty much right in the middle of the current month range. Bulls and Bears both have a chance to capitalize tomorrow.

Apple had a pretty unexciting day today finishing at a small 0.18% green. We saw it break its key support at the daily 20ema again of 171. However, it too saw an end of day bull run that hard rejected its daily 8ema at 173.72 to close at 172.14. With an already red after market i will look for that to continue over night. SPY bears will like to see Apple close its week out with a candle below the daily 20ema at 171 tomorrow with hopes of seeing 165-168 next week. However, the bulls need a close above the 8ema tomorrow. 

Range for tomorrow based off the current black bull channel puts us at 171.3 to 178 (unlimited upside tomorrow). The yellow bear channel (much like SPY) gives a range of 171.3 to 160 (unlimited downside tomorrow).

I'll never judge a someone for hedging their portfolio, but actively hoping for death, destruction and widespread bankruptcy is another thing entirely.

It's not very nice to want to see the world burn, so that you can make some money.

The next few weeks will tell that just like every other time we thought the end was here - the world is not actually going to cave in on itself.

I will bet you all my money (and I have) that the bottom was Monday.

Reasons why Monday was peak fear:

* The world is beginning to relax a bit as we understand that USA and Russia are not going to nuke each other
* Europe will not lose access to it's energy
* Fertilizers will not be sanctioned, and the crisis will not trigger a global famine
* Despite what the headlines say, Russia was not cut off entirely from SWIFT. Only some banks were.
* Both sides want some form of peace
* Just by looking at the inflationary data from 2021, you can see that we are about to hit an inflection point in inflation growth. The rise in inflation will start slowing until the actual YOY growth rate of inflation starts falling below 8%, then 7%, then 5% etc. Price levels will not fall, but the growth rate will.
* Oil is falling, and is taking pressure off inflation.
* The markets WANT interest rate hikes now. That means the rate hike today is GOOD NEWS.
* On Monday, SPY tested the 200 day and 50 day MA death cross. We bounced.
* Jerome Powell is about to whisper sweet soothing nothings into our ears, like he always does.

So in closing, if you were literally cheering for a global catastrophe in the form of WW3 and hyperinflation so that your stocks would go up:

# You. Are. A. Terrible. Person.

If that's you cheering for pain, fuck you and you deserve your losses.

After the splits in June will own about 700 shares of GOOG, 800 of AMZN and 600 of NVDA (not splitting). My plan is to sell 1 covered call for each of these 15-20% OTM at probably 1 month out (avoiding months with earnings months). Shoot holes in my plan.

24,679,The Big Flip - What the yield curve inversion means for your money,Discussion,"Finally, the yield curve has inverted. It’s something we were all expecting to happen ever since the Fed announced its rate hikes last month. The two-year yield settled in at 2.430% compared to the 2.374% yield of the 10-year U.S Treasury note last Thursday. This is the first time the two-year yield closed above the 10-year yield since 2019. Adding to this, the spread between [5-year and 30-year bonds inverted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-28/treasury-slide-sees-5-30-spread-invert-for-first-time-since-2006) for the first time since 2006! An inverted yield curve is a very prominent indicator for predicting an upcoming recession.

But, before we jump into the implications of the yield curve inversion, it’s important to understand what a yield curve is, how it predicts a recession, and what the previous data tells us.

https://preview.redd.it/bu3pugvy0is81.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e985edd7afffc4cb812239073c08bef5b2bde863

**What is the Yield Curve?**

The yield curve is just a graph showing the relationship between the short-term and long-term interest rates of the U.S Treasury bond. The bond here is the promise between you and the U.S govt that says if you loan some money now (by buying the bond), they will give it back to you later with an added interest.

https://preview.redd.it/jzej4we01is81.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ea73ab9a79b2b59ce278860bfdecae9bf26440

The above chart shows how a normal yield curve would look. The simple logic here is that it’s riskier for you to buy a longer-term bond *(the future is uncertain because of all the unknowns, good and bad, that could happen over years of time)* and you are rewarded proportionally for taking the larger risk. For eg., you would get a significantly lower interest rate if you are investing for 1-year vs 20-year as it’s generally riskier to stash away your money for a longer time period.

https://preview.redd.it/xxjaz9411is81.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69337c54556c499533e7da431ed0ed36b75beb8

But the yield curve is not always positive. If the long-term and the short-term rates get closer together, the yield curve become flat. Finally, if the short-term rates are higher than the long-term rates, the yield curve becomes inverted.

The yield curve becomes inverted when a lot of people are worried about the short-term economy. In theory, you would demand a higher return for taking on a higher risk. So if the yield rate for a short-term bond is higher than a longer-term bond, it implies that investors are so worried about the short-term economic outlook (*i.e they think the present is much riskier than the future*) that they are willing to invest in a longer-term bond at a lower rate.

**Where does the yield curve stand now?**

https://i.redd.it/6buvv2k41is81.gif

This excellent visualization by [Eeagli](https://www.eeagli.com/) shows how the yield curve has changed over the past 6 months. The yield curve hasn’t completely inverted yet, but still, it’s a cause for concern.

https://preview.redd.it/0t4lmyp51is81.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f9521b277b4bf5c4f678f84d7f937fee7dbd8d

The drastic difference that occurred in just the last year in the yield rates is visible in the above chart! Ideally, the yield rates are supposed to be in increasing order like it was in Apr 2021. Now the 2-year yield rate is more than the 10-year one and almost equal to the 30-year yield rate.

**Does Yield Curve Inversion Predict a Recession?**

The yield curve is considered one of the best signals that are currently available for predicting a recession. As per the research done by FRBSF,

>*Every U.S. recession in the past 60 years was preceded by a negative term spread, that is, an inverted yield curve. Furthermore, a negative term spread was always followed by an economic slowdown and, except for one time, by a recession. -* [*FRBSF*](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2018/march/economic-forecasts-with-yield-curve/)

https://preview.redd.it/s7oyvu971is81.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=9479357a888a4ef32f0af4b7586252a4afd8e07f

While the above results are for the spread between 1 and 10-year rates (which is still positive now), research done on 2-year and 10-year spreads shows a similar trend. According to [Commonwealth Financial Network](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/604484/inverted-yield-curve-stocks), the 10-and-2 yield curve has inverted 28 times since 1900, and in 22 of those instances, a recession has followed.

While there is certainly statistical merit for yield curve in predicting a recession, where experts are conflicted is in the type of spread that should be used. There are various different spreads we can consider (3-month vs 10-year, 1-year vs 10-year, 2-year vs 10-year, etc.). All of these provide different probabilities and timelines for an upcoming recession. For example, if you consider the 3-month vs 10-year spread (positive as of now), it has predicted every recession with [100% accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCQwiF0J7hw&ab_channel=CNBC) in the last 50 years.

**What’s the best thing to do now?**

Given that, an inverted yield curve is a reliable indicator of a looming economic downturn, what should we do to best prepare our portfolios incase a recession hits. The worst thing you can do now is to panic - especially when the yield curve inverts.

The problem is that even though yield curve inversion indicates a recession, it does so long before the actual recession hits. For eg, the tech bubble burst in Mar’01 but the yield curve had inverted almost 3 years before that (34 months to be exact). The same thing occurred again during the 2008 financial crisis when the yield curve inverted as early as 2005.

According to research conducted by[ LPL Financial,](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/604484/inverted-yield-curve-stocks) Yield curve inversion can be bullish for stocks, and the last four times the 2-and-10 yield curve inverted, the S&P 500 was up an average of 28.8% before it peaked!

https://preview.redd.it/099pv1m91is81.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab2a46fed2da581a022e2183c1d8df97e040e156

Adding to this, I had done an [**extensive analysis**](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/recession-primer?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web) on how the stock market performs during and following a recession.

https://preview.redd.it/g8n1n0ba1is81.png?width=889&format=png&auto=webp&s=239cdedaf68ca0b1d800ed8a2daf127495e06a25

On average, the U.S recessions lasted only 10 months and the market returned a +1.7% in return. What is even more interesting is the market performance just following the recession.

https://preview.redd.it/e4brta3b1is81.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=260627c7eb7e31e4d74fc215e905e4937b9d7c24

After the end of the recession, in just one year, you would have made money in 85% of the cases. And after 3 years, you would have been **in the green in 100% of the cases!**

**Conclusion**

Predicting future economic developments is a tricky business! There are 100’s of factors that are different than the last time, but an inverted yield curve is one of the most reliable predictors we have for accurately predicting a recession.

But as we could see from the analysis, it takes a while for the economy to finally go into recession after the curve has been inverted and you will miss out on the gains till then if you stay out of the market. If you are feeling truly adventurous, you can always try keeping a certain portion of your portfolio out and try to buy the [inevitable dip.](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/is-waiting-for-a-dip-the-best-investment?s=w)

90,2864,Is oil >$100/barrel a problem for the US economy?,Discussion,"I think yes. I called up 20 trucking companies when oil hit $120/barrel and all activity ceased. Basically freight rates were flat to down as retailers have no visibility on demand, while fuel was significantly up.

People have grown far less concerned about oil price over the past few days. I think the are missing 2 major points (1) US is depleting its reserves and dumping oil to manage the price (2) china has been VERY weak and is the largest consumer of oil behind the US and the largest importer

1. Dumping out of SPR is a short term fix. Adding 60mm barrels is meaningful (30mm from US after depleting 50mm in November). As a comparison, Russia produced 3.7mm barrels/day in 2019. So its basically like adding an entire new county worth of supply for \~15-30days. Keep in mind the reserves are not that big. Only \~600mm barrels - I think 15+ year low
2. What happens when the Chinese economy recovers? Not that I am seeing any signs of that, but its been over 2 years now and I would have to think that China will come up with some solution to address COVID at some point.

Here is some supply/demand data from the EIA ...i am concerned. I have no idea how the Fed is so confident on economic growth. Would love to hear thoughts.

37,1006,Booked my Train Ticket on the Tilray Express just yesterday,Discussion,"Good morning fellow gorillas. It's been 14 straight months that I have been watching $TLRY get it's ass pounded. I was here for weed gang 1.0 last March and have seen the price slowly dwindle from $22.00 all the way down to $4.88. Over the past 4 months I've been slowly buying shares and had $7000 total in shares as of last Thursday. Woke up yesterday to shares being up 30% and figured it was going to be another streak of news bumping the price up for a day or two and then coming back down like it has every other day for the last 14 months, so I sold all my shares to buy back in on the price drop. It wasn't until about 1:00 pm that I realized congress is voting on federal legalization of marijuana again. With the house voting next week, I realized I made a mistake in selling. Bought back in at about 3:00 pm and bought another $2000 in shares. I'm sitting at $10,802.70 right now with markets closed.

Now I know what you guys might be thinking, ""What is this guy, fucking retarded?"" and yes, you would be right. But allow me and my 70 points of IQ to explain why the next few weeks are going to be wild. Ballotpedia shows the makeup of congress before and after the 2020 election.

Last time this was voted on, the house was a clean sweep with 228 for and 164 against. Then stalled in the senate. This time around there is still a blue majority in the house. If that passes, it's smooth sailing until it reaches the senate again. This time around were looking at 48/50 blue/red in the senate vs the 45/53 the last time this happened. Not only that, but it's been over a year since then I'm betting that time will slowly turn government heads in favor of recreational marijuana. This would open many doors for companies that are waiting on this lottery ticket and I'm betting that the growth of these companies and the hype around cannabis stocks is going to take this sky high.

Glad there aren't many eyes on this at the moment with all the GME hype. I've been trying to save up to go back to graduate school, so if this fails at least I know I was too stupid to go back to college anyways. If this shit goes tits up, I'll make sure my friends have my login info so they can post my obituary to WSB when I invest in $ROPE.

62,2331,Will bond market selling leak into stocks?,Discussion,"Bonds could face even more downside after Fed Chair Powell’s hawkish speech on Monday. With yields still near ultra-low levels, and the war in Ukraine set add to the record-high inflation, demand for bonds is likely to remain suppressed as a more aggressive rate hike cycle is probably needed.

Equities, on the other hand have held up relatively well so far, but we only have to go back to 2018 to see the negative effect an overly hawkish Fed can have on the stock market. Given the current state of inflation and supply chains, this upcoming tightening cycle will likely be even more intense. 

Using the S&P500 as a broader market gauge, the inability to consolidate the close above the 200-day MA yesterday might be an indication of profit-taking following the recent rally, and if shorts also see this as a good re-entry point, it could potentially drag $SPX back below the key 4400 level.

However, stocks are also currently providing a decent inflation hedge, and the market could continue to trend higher if the Fed navigates this rate hike path correctly. The lack of volume on yesterday’s decline might be an important signal that larger investors aren’t selling, and if $SPX can form a higher low above 4400, it might allow the overall market to sustain an uptrend. 

All trading carries risk, but it should be interesting to see how inflation and monetary policy plays out across assets in the coming weeks.",tm29l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tm29l2/will_bond_market_selling_leak_into_stocks/,NEGATIVE,0.9997518658638

110,2279,4-6-22 SPY/ Apple Daily TA,Technical Analysis,"  

The coveted FOMC minutes release finally happened. What did we learn? Well not a whole lot new honestly. All we have learned is that clearly JPOW are hawkish and ready to do another 0.5bps hike in May at the next meeting. We also learned that the previously doveish members are now even hawkish. 

SPY had a massive gap down at open today from 451 close all the way to 447.3 at open, which of course left a big gap on the daily chart. We know how SPY does not like to leave gaps too… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qmol7nkx10s81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ed997097c5eed44c67a2a7a65e5a4f3fd8e8606

Intraday despite the massively red pre-market and first big red candle SPY traded within a pretty tight range hovering around 445.5 from 945am to 130pm. We saw some green start to take off right before the minutes dropped. They got a lot of people with the fake out (me included) with running it all the way to 448.5 before they dropped it like its hot to 444.2 immediately after. From there I saw some of the craziest intraday swings in such a short period of time that I have ever seen. 

Spy dropped from 448.5 to a low of 443.47 (-1.1%, $5) rose to a high of 448.93 (+1.23%, $5.5) and then dipped to 445.32 (-0.8%, $3.5) and rose to 448 (+0.6%, $2.7) all within two hours of trading. That kind of volatility has not been seen in quite a long time. And being end of the day those who were brave enough to play 0dte made some incredible gains. I was able to recoup my losses plus 2x daily profit on one 0dte put on the initial -1.1% drop along with a few call plays to hit 6x daily profit in one day. 

&#x200B;

It is not surprising that we traded so close to 445.5 all day as that level is a key support of the Daily 20ema. It looked like when the minutes released we may see an aggressively red day and close below those key supports near the 440 level, however, 445 proved to be too strong to break through today. We also found out that 448 to 449 was major resistance too, as anytime we touched it end of day we immediately rejected down.

With a clear MACD sell and RSI trending downward now, favor to bears short term.

On the daily chart you can see we technically still have about an 89 cent gap from 448.93 to 449.82. Some could argue a gap this small is not important and will not be filled yet. One also may argue since its to the upside the push to close it now is not there as much as a gap below would be. Todays close and post market still have some bearish flavor to it. However, being able to close about the EMAs is fairly bullish. 

Intraday tomorrow and overnight we need to see if 1. The gap will be filled up to 449.82 and 2. If the daily 20ema (447.05), daily 100ema (446.7) and daily 50ema (445.2) is going to hold as support intraday tomorrow with the daily 50ema being the key support. If we were to get a bullish push tomorrow the daily 8ema at 451.37 will now come in to play as possible resistance. Failure for bulls to break and close above that again would be bearish. 

If the bears were to get another true bear day I would suspect they will try to close near the 200ema at 439.82. That being the final support bulls have to hold before we would see 410-420 again.

The weekly candle is now coming in fairly bearish after a doji last week would hint to me that we very well could see some red next week also. Key support for bulls to hold would be the weekly 8ema at 444.88 and the weekly 20ema at 446.43. A close back below those would all be confirm a dip next week back near the weekly 50ema of 435.07.

The VIX had yet another massive day today from its low of 21.24 to its highest point of 24.78 ranging 16.6% of movement. This is three massive movement days for VIX in a row, yet we have not really seen a massive 2%+/- day for SPY yet. I believe tomorrow or Friday it is coming. 

The VIX key level to watch is 24.5 for the bears and 22 for the bulls. Now that the VIX is back ABOVE the average of 16.5 to 21.5 the bulls are in favor here as its is usually easier for VIX to unwind down with no new news than to go up.

Apple is looking similar to SPY on the daily chart with a clear MACD sell, and rsi at 53 trending down. Apple also has a pretty significant gap from 174.42 to 173.63 (0.45%, 0.79) on the daily chart. 

Apple found support today at its daily 20ema which has not ben touched in over two weeks. 

Apple bulls need a green day tomorrow to fill the gap up to a 174.42, however, they will need to break now resistance at the daily 8ema. 

Apple bears will look for a close below the daily 20ema at 170.96. Bears will not need a very red day to accomplish this and their ultimate goal will be to get Apple below the daily 50ema at 168.44(only -2% from todays close) by end of the week. If bears can accomplish this 157 to 165 will be back in play. A close below the daily 100ema of 165.31 (-3.8% from close) while a very tough chore to accomplish in two days, it is not out of possibility for Apple depending how markets react. 

The questions going into tomorrow is now that the markets have the full minutes from FOMC and nothing news wise until April 12th with the next CPI data…. Which I fully expect to be awful and another emergency/ surprise rate hike. With the markets now seeing the true hawkish fed and the new info about the balance sheets/ QT and rate hikes is the markets going to go back into full panic mode like January? Or will the markets too quickly price this in and return to full rally mode? 

I will be looking at tomorrows close and more importantly Fridays close for that clue. We have key supports and resistance that will give us a clue going into next week. 

I will be back on the sever all day tomorrow after taking the morning off for personal errands and I will also have a proper pre market post up around 9am tomorrow on the server for everyone. 

10% challenge-

Today was a pretty good day for me.

As I said I was gone all morning and ended up not trading till about 1230. I entered some Apple and Spy puts around that time that I held till the first big green candle at 2pm and sold both for -50%. I then was able to grab a nice 80% 0dte play on the way down to recoup those loses + x2 my daily gains goalI had another 2dte -20% put that I played on the first recovery bounce when it faked us out red before ripping green (which is when I entered calls). I then played two different 2dte calls one for 40% and one for 30%. Overall being able to hit 6x my daily profit goal is incredible. I look to go into Thursday and Friday with low risk and being very conservative as I do not want to risk losing all these gains on silly plays. Friday if I have a good day tomorrow will look for a slightly higher risk on than usual though.",ty0731,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ty0731/4622_spy_apple_daily_ta/,NEGATIVE,0.9997095465660096
58,2255,How is the NASDAQ going to react to today's CPI data?,Discussion,"Global equity markets are feeling the weight of soaring yields. Tech stocks in particular have come under pressure, and could be in for further downside as the US 10-year yield climbing to its highest level since 2018. 

The NASDAQ100’s rejection from its 200-day last week was the second time in approx. 2 months that the index failed to hold above this key technical level, potentially signalling a double top formation. Today’s inflation data is expected to come in above 8%, and if it can support yields to rise further in the build-up to the Fed’s next meeting, $NDX could be at risk of testing, and potentially breaking below, its previous lows around the key psychological level of 13,000.

However, despite the likelihood of prices remaining elevated in the foreseeable future, today’s CPI print might mark the peak of inflation. If the market decides to focus on this angle instead, it could help limit losses in the stock market, and potentially allow $NDX to form a higher low before attempting another break above its 200-day MA.

# Rapidly Ballooning Short-Borrow Fees

[Ortex's tweet](https://twitter.com/ORTEX/status/1506331956379750402?cxt=HHwWhMCs3d67yOcpAAAA) shows that short-sale interest did not decrease in yesterday's 50% price increase.  Instead, it went up to 24% of the free float.  Some would ask how the short increase from 21% to 24% in one business day is possible on an already-capped-out-for-31-days 100% utilization?  I digress - and we already know the answer as to why: they somehow obtained more shares to short with, as unreported, and clearly have not even begun to buy to cover their 'current plus new' short-sales yet.  Either way, these shorting-hedge-funds, nevertheless, are now facing elevated capital requirements.  We know that Ortex shows that max cost to borrow just jumped to over 45%, but let's take a look at Interactive Brokers borrow fee:

&#x200B;

[IBKR's short-borrow rate has jumped above 12,000&#37; \(after hours\).  This is statistically significant, as you can visually see the range breakout in the chart.  Pre-market and nominal open borrow rate may indeed be sustained above 100&#37;, which implies an immediate, newfound demand for collateral for those with outsized short-borrows](https://preview.redd.it/0azs5d2bu2p81.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c75056fd43e3b460fcd69bac80a9a777bf5ca1c)

# Half of  G M E  Shares are now 'locked' and not transactable

Contrary to what was implied about me [by mainstream media yesterday](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-shares-soar-30-and-take-other-meme-stocks-on-a-ride-after-reddit-poster-touts-shares-at-a-58-2-discount-11647988145), my fundamental technical analysis was not the primary catalyst of the immediate supply-and-demand-based 50% rise in the share price.  I don't suspect that a billionaire, or anyone really, analyzed [my TA yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tjw86u/g_m_e_where_we_stand_with_the_technicals/) and decided, ""Oh, Thump4's TA shows that the stock is heavily discounted, so I must buy it.""

The real catalyst seems to have been from raw demand, and most notably by G M E's chairman, who independently bought 100,000 more G M E shares in the morning, making his total ownership of the company 11.9%.  Although we have no data on what insiders are buying until SEC 13F forms are filed, insiders may indeed be continuing to purchase more raw shares since they are now able to 2 days after earnings.  Yet, this brings up an interesting technical topic: insider ownership shares are 'locked,' meaning these shares are *not* freely traded on the market.  Therefore, when we combine G M E's Directly Registered computershare total (10 Million shares registered with the transfer agent - 8.9M as noted from the [F-17 Page (page 10 on the pdf of last week's annual report)](https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/71e30d98-2102-4bdd-b0b8-eb151e09f803) and 1M+ estimates thereafter) with 23 Million shares institutionally owned ([as shown from fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)) and thereby restricted, then we have a *past-looking sum* of 33 Million.  We can safely assume that 3 Million more shares will be either bought by insiders and/or directly registered with computershare this week (provided the newfound demand for the stock), so we are at 36 Million shares 'locked'.  Since the shares outstanding total is 76.34 Million, then that means that ***47.2% of the tradable shares outstanding are currently 'locked' and not able to be transacted on any market exchange, regardless of whether that market exchange is 'dark' or 'lit'****.*  This inherently implies that any movement in G M E 's  market price is about twice as sensitive to normal economic demand-vs-supply forces than a typical stock, because the float is literally cut in half.

This leads to a G M E stock price that is now hypersensitive to any demand for the stock, or net volume.  That was shown above, and a two-fold increase in nominal pressure on short-sellers who must fold their poker cards and buy-to-cover their egregious ([and some would say illegal](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-prosecutors-explore-racketeering-charges-short-seller-probe-sources-2022-02-18/)) short-borrow liability position.  Them not doing so would technically lead to a [London-Metal-Exchange-like](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-chinese-nickel-market-mystery-london-metal-exchange-tsinghsan-11647982954) scenario, where in this case the entire global stock market would have to be halted for days for the NSCC to theoretically but illegally allow Citadel Securities, Point72, and other hedge funds to somehow maintain their shorts, similarly to the Chinese nickel short-selling 'tycoon.'  This scenario would permanently destroy faith in American markets for decades.  Them buying to cover now, while the price is still so discounted is safer for them, more responsible for the safety of American markets, and would allow for them to possibly survive this and be able to happily talk about how they got beat (kinda like the Citron Research guy who loved to claim afterward that he was so handsomely defeated by a bunch of reddit 'kids' in this generationally-dynamic market).

# Astronautical Fundamentals - the new digital-asset Marketplace

&#x200B;

[G M E 's non-fungible-asset marketplace is now out in 'beta'.  This being released in the evening, could serve as a new catalyst of buying demand for G M E stock, in that it will lead to a new revenue stream on sales of virtual art and gaming skins, worldwide](https://preview.redd.it/8ypcg42693p81.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a05ad79bfa9e563e115ce9bb63d0bfb5c041050)

# TLDR:

Half of  G M E 's shares are locked and not able to be further transacted.  This has caused an economic shortage of available supply of the stock - and this available supply clearly is rapidly diminishing.  Ortex max cost to borrow just ballooned above 45%, and IBKR's borrow fee rate just ballooned above 12,000%, marking a serious collateral demand and high probability of margin calls of short-sale positions: those short-sellers who now stand to face unlimited economic loss based on the elevated risk they fairly took by shorting this stock.  On Company fundamentals, the[ beta N..F..T.. marketplace website is out](https://beta.nft.gamestop.com/), implying the additional revenue stream from virtual art and gaming skin collectibles [is now live and powered on the backend by loop-ring L2](https://medium.loopring.io/gamestop-nft-marketplace-powered-by-loopring-l2-6cdb9289d937).  Technicals reveal that G M E 's Net Volume, from yesterday's 50% increase in share price, was paltry.  Volume is about 85 Million away from even being classified as a historically-noteworthy day for G M E.

Edit: I am not considering fiddling with my DRS'd shares, nor am I closing [any of my call options positions](https://imgur.com/a/e5upBh9) at any point, even though I am up about 1000% yesterday.  I am upset that my transfer of my tax return into this account did not lead to a successful execution of my order for new call options.  But, I am confident that my new market order for them - yes, I know - for today will be executing at these prices that are clearly so discounted to the real net asset value.  When G M E 's return on their investment is realized, the stock could be worth $1,000.00's of dollars per share, but as a newer, sleeker, Web 3.0, block-chain-backed, highly-sophisticated Amazon-killer.

Edit2 10:19am EST: Macro markets are down, and investors should watch G M E 's notable negative beta to see if that negative beta will 'hold up', or if the stock could become 'entrained' in the macro bear market as noted with the falling dow jones and nasdaq today.  It'll be interesting to observe.  (In January 2021, GameStop's rise did technically 'take down' the market on the beginning of hedge-funds' closing of other long positions that served as liquidity to support their egregious short-borrows - all until the removal of the buy button for  G M E  of course - in violation of securities laws \[FINRA\])",tkp1x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tkp1x9/g_m_e_giveth_us_more_technicals_they_said/,NEGATIVE,0.9996577501296996

It's just a Tuesday, yet today's Market Price for 💲 **G M E**  touched upon $448,950.00 per share according to a screenshot of the highest 'last' price (2 shares), at least $510.00 per share according to options triggers, $370.00 per share according to some charts, $275.00 per share according to a transactional verification, while only obtaining $200.00 per share according to nominal 'lit' exchange data.  Let's analyze today's activity:

&#x200B;

[💲 G M E Price Action from this morning reveals outsized, acute demand for the stock - Although separate evidence suggests that $448,950.00 was obtained today per share \(2 shares\), this move triggered in-the-money notifications for what were out-of-the-money options, with investors with call options as high as $510.00 - Note that the 15-month high from pre-market on 28JAN2021 was $508.04 \(moments before the buy-button was removed that morning\), indicating that 💲 G M E is 'seeking' its free-economic-market price which may be above $508.04 or $510.00 per share](https://preview.redd.it/ifov1cwc4dq81.jpg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46735e04aa9b732a880e7eebe797625e8d097949)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Technicalities

&#x200B;

[ This morning, 💲 G M E experienced a \\""routine\\"" volatility trading halt - The ticker ran up in the first five minutes after the open, before being brought down, in an orchestrated fashion that was likely designed to 'attempt to induce panic selling' - At 9:37:30 a.m. EST the stock was hit by a mysterious onslaught of superhigh-frequency 100-share-block-short-sells - One can observe the mass-coordinated 182.79 share sales, the next order a few pennies below this coordinated wall triggered the limit-down halt - This NYSE halt for a few minutes removed investors ability to freely invest. The fact that this same price action with exact timings took place with 💲 A M C reveals that this was an ETF-induced maneuver via the 'Meme-Stock' basket - The halt was followed by some consolidation - Contrary to the likely intent of the maneuver, 💲 G M E 'overcame' with a price recovery in less than one investing hour](https://preview.redd.it/r9cuito1wfq81.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=671c5df378cb65f70d45c1506284d9158dc9bd56)

&#x200B;

As displayed above, today, Hedge Funds abused their market function to purposefully and successfully *exploit* the Limit-Up-Limit-Down ([LULD](https://www.luldplan.com/)) protective-feature of the New York Stock Exchange.  This created a few minute pause in investing that served to attenuate investing.  The original spirit of that rule is to serve as a 9:45 am EST market halt feature that mitigates volatile and disorderly investing.  There was nothing disorderly about a 7% increase in the 'lit' exchange price.  But, the halt mysteriously took place earlier than it's supposed to: at 9:37 a.m. EST.  In speculation of their motive and technique, by Hedge Funds assisting the 5-minute rise on the buy side (thereby dragging up the average price), they then forced the price down with high-frequency short-sales (thereby quickly triggering the 5% volatility down limit).

💲 **G M E**  investors who owned the stock through January 2021, when mainly limit-up halts were experienced multiple times per trading day, have classified this price action as '*routine*' and '*part of the game*.'  Investors should be aware, however, that Hedge Fund(s) intentional manipulation of a security like this - in order to force a market halt - does constitute a gross violation of securities laws, as it is arbitrary and capricious behavior within markets, as well as abuse of the good-faith market function of a Hedge Fund.  On the other hand, for the rightful investors of this company, who intend on long term company ownership, these minute-long declines could be viewed as 'acute discounts,' allowing for faster ownership of the company per dollar.  This is especially so, theoretically, if the investor then utilizes those free discounts and is more readily able to remove the earned share from DTCC market 'lending' and 'locates' circulation by registering their newly-acquired-artificially-discounted shares directly with the transfer agent.

This pause did prevent investors from being able to freely transact for a few minutes, and may have been a technique for the Hedge Fund(s) involved to not only ""buy more time,"" but to make a quick jolt of profit.  It is also possible that these funds were well aware of the timing of such a manuever, and were perhaps given a 5-minute window to make transactions before they manipulated the price downward (creating a short duration but high magnitude 'pump' and 'dump').  Similar 'short-ladder attacks' also occurred today at 2:56 p.m. EST and 3:37 p.m. EST.  Performing three outsized 'short-ladder attacks' in one business day, while unable to harm the price nor adversely attenuate the natural demand for the stock, in-all-likelihood has even further substantially increased Hedge Funds' short-borrow liabilities.  We would be able to observe this using tomorrow's live Ortex data.  But, let's look at today's available data:

* 💲 **A M C**  experienced success with the movie 'Batman,' and showed success not only with its digital-asset payments for movie tickets, but with dynamic pricing
* 💲 **G M E**  Chairman Ryan Cohen, among other insiders, have purchased daily droves of raw shares of the company.  In the case of the chairman, his ownership has grown to 11.9%
* 💲 **G M E**  has a newfound digital-asset marketplace (with an art example, see below) that is not only in beta, but it is already collecting *transaction revenues*
* 💲 **G M E**  as evidenced from legal spokespeople on twitter (yet to be officially verified), may have recruited Keith Gill, also known as Reddit User DeepFuckingValue, as a company employee to take charge of various roles.  Further evidence is needed to verify this claim.

# Conclusion

1. Data shows that 💲 **G M E**  touched upon $448,950.00 per share, $510.00 per share, $370.00 per share, $275.00 per share, and $200.00 per share today.  This may seem confusing, but in reality, there are two types of exchanges: those we can see ('lit') and those we cannot ('dark pools').  It appears that off-exchange ('dark pool') prices went ""to the Moon"" today before a down-limit volatility halt was purposefully-induced (via an orchestrated maneuver by hedge funds where shares were expelled onto the market in superhigh-frequency block trades, 52,200 of which were of the same exact price of $182.79).  💲 **G M E**  investors referred to their observation of this type of attack as '*routine*.'  Just prior to this maneuver, in-the-money notifications of significantly out-of-the-money options were triggered above $510.00.  Nevertheless, 'lit' prices then stabilized, consolidated, and resumed an upward trajectory. 💲 **G M E**  thereby recovered, contrary to the designed-intent of hedge funds' short-selling maneuver, thereby placing even more short-liability risk onto hedge funds tomorrow.
2. On the technicals, the true economic market price is clearly being sought somewhere above $510.00 per share, and to note - the previous high was $508.04 per share on 28JAN2021, moments before brokerages' removal of the 'buy' button.  Today's chart does reveal a favorable ascending wedge chart pattern, as well as a sustained and elevated price departure above the 50 Period Simple Moving Average (30 minute price box-plot durations).  The short-sale interest only grew - now to 22.6 Million shares for short-borrow, now at January 2021 peak levels.  Utilization for shorting is still 100%, and the interest rate to short-borrow with some brokers has ballooned to 85%.  There are three additional investing days in this week.
3. This evidences an outsized risk to any institutional-class client who has investments managed by a hedge fund who may be over-shorting this stock, as hedge funds are now 'in duress' with likely only several business days remaining until this type of price action reaches 'lit' exchanges.  Continued price action now paints a bona fide Bankruptcy risk (upon margin liquidation forced-buy-ins) to these shorting-hedge-funds, while the FBI, DOJ, and SEC continue to hawk their every move for evidence of naked shorting.  Lending counterfeit shares, for selling a company's stock short, is a Class C Felony - it is punishable via 20 Years Prison Sentencing.

# TLDR

💲 **G M E**  is 'freely seeking' its true, economic, market price.  On 28JAN2021, the price was $508.04 moments before removal of the buy button.  Today, $510.00 call options were triggered as being 'in the money.'  Charts displayed transacted prices up to $370.00 per share, and logs displayed 300 shares transacted of $275.00 per share.  Further, ask prices, during a temporary halt, indicated 💲 **G M E**  was worth $448,950.00 per share on the ask.  Bloomberg terminal data too evidences these prices.  On the 'lit' NYSE, the price after the open rose to about $200 per share.  Then, as purposefully-orchestrated \[via superhigh-frequency block short-sale orders at 9:35 a.m. EST\], the price was short-laddered down for a few minutes. 💲 **G M E**  investors faced a few-minute halt at 9:37 a.m. EST that \[as evidence suggests\] was engineered by Hedge Fund(s) in order to stay ahead of the trade, perhaps profit, while halting investment opportunities.  Yet, on natural demand for the stock, the market price recovered within the hour, retesting previous highs on the day.  Adding to Hedge Funds' risks of liquidation of their clients' assets, short-borrows have now further increased.  This was even more so accelerated, provided today's 'absorption' of three rounds of short-selling in the same business day (and on a relatively high 17M volume).  Interest rates to borrow are now up to 85%, Short Interest is 25% of the float, there have been 35 days of 100% Utilization, and January 2021 levels of shares on loan (22.6 Million) are now present.  💲 **G M E**  investors referred to their observation of this type of investing day as '*routine.'*  Owners of company shares, who invested through January 2021, experienced multiple limit-up halts *per day,* and at least one 'neutral' day was anticipated.

127,1643,What’s the argument against going COST over total market index funds?,Company Discussion,"COST has destroyed the market’s returns for a while now. It’s an extremely stable company with lots of room for growth. Perhaps more importantly, especially right now, it holds up pretty well in a bear market. Of course there is still risk in investing in this company alone, but is a total market ETF really a better move? Would you not be beating the market if you invested in something like COST during a recession?

For example I have built my own portfolio for the most part but I still have around 15% in a total market ETF. Would it be stupid to sell and buy COST (and similar companies that fair well in this type of market)? 

I’m interested in hearing some thoughts on the matter.

Edit: I recognize that COST is just one company and broad ETFs are many. Obviously there is a lot of unsystematic risk with that, especially long term. But in the medium term, COST + a handful of similar companies seems like a solid alternative  that could fair better in a bear market",txxlif,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/txxlif/whats_the_argument_against_going_cost_over_total/,NEGATIVE,0.99951434135437

79,2577,Trean Insurance Group (TIG),Discussion,"Too all the gay bears, bulls, and tendie seeking degenerets on this sub i am happy to say that after telling myself i was just going to look at this subreddit and not get ahead of myself with investing I am now down $250 out of my first $1000 invested. Although a little discouraged I started to read some of those investing for dummies books (because lets admit it if we are on WSB then we are all dummies) and i'm happy to say that im throwing the rest of what i have into one stock. One glorious, low volume, beautiful stock… how could this possibly go wrong?!?

 

What is this glorious stock? Why am I throwing the rest of my account at it? Probably because i don't know what the hell i'm doing but ill tell you why i think its a good idea anyways. Introducing Trean Insurance Group. This is a small cap insurance company that specializes in specialty casualty insurance products. The price has been on the decline since their IPO last year and although I agree that they are not worth even close to what their IPO got pushed up to I do think that the result of the brutal beat down over the past year is not justified. 

 

Before we get too far into why i think its a good buy lets preface this with talking about why the stock fell after the latest earnings. During the last earnings release the company announced that during their fourth quarter of 2021 they experienced an unexpected high claims that pushed their EPS down to around $0.02 for the quarter. This was the second quarter in the fiscal year that had unexpectedly low earnings which resulted in severely depressed EPS for the year at $0.38. This is down over 80% from their previous years earnings. This decreased earnings paired with their CEO retiring after leading the company through 25 years of profit investors ran. But they ran too far…

 

The first positive thing I want to look at is the management and insiders of the company. Yes, the CEO did retire but he DID NOT LEAVE THE COMPANY. He is now the executive chairman on the board of directors. This means he will still be able to offer corporate governance to the new CEO despite being removed from day to day operations. Speaking about the new CEO, they hold a resume that is definitely nothing to shake a stick at. With over 15 years experience directly reporting to the prior CEO they have a good idea of how their particular business is run and i have full faith that they will be able to maintain the growth and stability that they have haad for the past 25 years. Looking further at the insiders you can see that there were a lot of sales by the insiders during the last quarter of 2021. This could have indicated the bad earnings however a good sign is that as soon as the stock dropped on the 9th and 10th insiders bought over 30,000 shares. In fact, since the start of 2022 no insider has sold any considerable amount of shares! 

 

Now i know what you are saying, who cares about the management show me the money! To that all i have to say is shut the f*** up and let me finish. After all if you have read this far your already past like 80% of the people on this sub who see a wall of text and move on to posts with cooler pictures. 

 

Looking at the financials of this company is where things start to get really exciting in my opinion. This company is PROFITABLE! Even with extremely high claims for the year they were still able to produce a profit from their received premiums. Looking at their premiums they were able to increase their written premiums by 30.9% this year and their gross revenue also increased by $12,239,000. Additionally they were able to increase the cash they received by operations by 88.67%. They spent a lot of this cash in their investment cash flow where they invested over double the cash that they made in operations. Yes, this did eat up some of their cash on hand and it does limit liquidity but we are living in a time of high inflation and having their money in investments instead of cash is actually better for retaining value. Additionally, their current ratio is still well over 1 with the spent cash so there is no worry in my mind of them running out of the over 100 million that they still have in cash. Their are several other indicators that i think show Trean will be successful within their financial statements but i will leave the rest of the digging up to you degenerates because im getting sick of typing.

85,2708,Borrowing with collateral?,Discussion,"I am not really informed about the new unrealized gains tax bill that is talked about and economics in general but some people have the argument that you can’t tax unrealised gains because it would force billionaires to sell stock and lower share value. 

This makes sense in my head.

The counter argument is : if you can’t taxe unrealised gains you should not be able to borrow with stock as collateral because you are borrowing on assets that are not realized and not taxed. 

This does not make sense in my head.

If you borrow money with stock as collateral you would eventually need to pay tax when you sell stock to pay your debt. 

I don’t know if it’s possible but if you can directly transfer stock to a bank they would need to buy it at a discount price because they need to pay tax when they sell. 

If you die with all the stock I assume stock will get automatically sold to repay debt and in consequence pay tax and if stocks are transferred to children they would need to pay hereditary tax.

So I am not trying to criticize any view but I would like know where my train of thinking is wrong .

180,2004,Bull Case for $HD (Home Depot),Company Analysis,"Hi friends, I am not an expert stock trader/investor by any means but I thought I’d mention how Home Depot is a solid buy for me. Home Depot is currently the 27th most valuable stock by market cap, and I think it will continue to grow.

1. In the 3 month chart, SPY is down 4% whereas HD is down 22%. I don’t think HD deserved to be hit harder than SPY in this bear market, so I think putting your money into HD has higher potential for growth than companies that went down in proportion with SPY.
2. Bears on HD are mentioning that people remodeled their house a lot during the covid pandemic but the pandemic is coming to an end. My response: People really will find any reason to be bearish. Not every stock is a pandemic stock. Google is a pandemic stock too because people will stop googling about covid, etc. 
3. I think people don’t realize that Home Depot is not just a store that sells hammers and nails. They deserve to be put in the same category as companies like Walmart who always have potential to do more.
4. The “Home” category is generic enough that they have potential to break into many different other industries. I could definitely see them competing with companies like Best Buy in the tech industry (did you know that Home Depot sells TVs?). They could also venture into industries like furniture, maybe compete with IKEA. 
5. The company has a good reputation for being a reliable and friendly company that treats their salaried employees well (yes their minimum wage employees will probably have things to complain about but that’s every company).
6. They are dominant in both brick and mortar stores and in ecommerce. What’s not to like about that?
7. I’m not well versed enough to look at their financials and judge their stock price based on that, but they are way down from their ATH, and I just think the stock market is a ponzi scheme anyway that doesn’t have much connection to the fundamentals like that. Home Depot has no signs of doing poorly as a company, and quarter after quarter I expect their price to go up at a faster rate than SPY.",tp10fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tp10fq/bull_case_for_hd_home_depot/,NEGATIVE,0.9992369413375854
153,2216,Potential ASPN contract with GM for EV's?,Company Discussion,"When you first look at ASPN (Aspen Aerogels), you'll probably notice the bad fundamentals right away. -25 PE ratio, YoY revenue growth is down over 30% (but this may be due to supply chain issues), and a price to book ratio over 12. So why am I talking about this?

I was looking for major insider buys, and I stumbled across something very interesting. After two years of constant insider selling, the company director, Robert Gervis, made a $4.5M purchase of company stock last week.

So why would the company director buy stock in a company with shitty fundamentals?Aerogels are usually used in the oil industry and rocket ships, but when you go to Aspen's company website, they had a product that stuck out to me. They have a special aerogel made for insulating the batteries on EVs called Pyrothin. Accroding to the website its ""Starting at only 2mm thickness, our [**thermal runaway barriers**](https://www.aerogel.com/industries/battery-thermal-barriers/) can be tailored to perform in critical applications, including:

* Cell-to-cell thermal runaway propagation
* Battery pack and module barriers""

Now, if you live in the midwest, you probably know that EV's are bad here, the cold weather reduces battery life in the winter, and the hot summers damage the battery. Owning an EV here is an expensive money pit, and you'd save more time and money driving a BMW on our salt covered roads. Aerogels are great insulators, and if applied to a lithium battery, it would stop the batteries from A) starting fires, and B) make the battery life last longer and keep more consistent range.

On top of that, if you go to their investor page, the company CEO had some comments on their Pyrothin Aerogel:

Mr. Young commented, ""We are projecting solid revenue growth in each of our principal markets during 2022, including a tripling of our EV thermal barrier revenue to $20.0 million for the year. We are also increasing our investment levels during the year to keep pace with our rapidly growing e-mobility opportunities. This investment will be focused on establishing an automated fabrication operation in Mexico and enhancing the technical, commercial and operational teams and associated resources supporting our thermal barrier and carbon aerogel battery materials businesses.""

Mr. Young continued, ""While these planned investments will expand our Adjusted EBITDA loss and net loss in 2022 versus 2021, they position us for strong growth in revenue and profitability through the decade. Based on customer forecasts and our thermal barrier quoting activity, we are targeting to double our revenue to nearly $240 million by 2023 and to triple revenue from that level by 2025; and have the opportunity to deliver strong revenue growth thereafter through the decade with continued growth in demand for our PyroThin thermal barriers, the strong potential of our Aspen Battery Materials business and with other new business opportunities created by leveraging our Aerogel Technology PlatformTM.""

Now, I don't know for sure if GM will be that contractor, but it seems pretty likely. GM has said that it wants to produce 30 new EV cars by 2025, and wants to go all electric by 2035. On top of this, I think GM has already done some business with ASPN, and even named them one of their 2021 Overdrive award winners. GM is also planning to make fully electric Equinoxes, Silverados, and Blazers in 2023, and if you don't know, those are pretty much the only cars people buy from GM in the midwest, and if they can make these cars have a usable range and battery lilfe, people here are gonna buy these up.

Let me explain why. This is an optionsscheine. Apparently, it's a derivative, kind of like an option and kind of like a warrant.

But here is the catch, this is what's termed a knock-out warrant, it means that if the prices reaches a determined gain or loss in value, it is automatically closed.

I also read from a user that in the German Market, these are not open market derivatives and are controlled by the sole issuer who can close the position at any point in time. (Don't know how accurate that is), but, its a positive and negative knock-out warrant.

This means that the gains are capped, and you inherit greater risk of losses because if it falls below a fixed price whether positive or negative, they close out your position on you.

This fucking retard threw $600.00 bucks at a Swiss military stock as a long shot bet, and got 4,957.28% gain on a god damn knock-out warrant.

Talk about retarded and talk about wow. You enjoy those gains buddy u/Guns-and-Pumpkins.

I don't know about you guys, but this shit is amazing to see in comparison to the rich daddy money that gets thrown around in here.

Optionsscheine are by far way more riskier then our options and warrants. Shits crazy.

Edit: By the way, these are not Rubles here, these are in Euro dollars.

Edit: Seems as per a comment below, it does just say optionsscheine and would then be just a regular options trade. Never the less, still very impressive.

93,2893,Ban on Russian metals ?,Discussion,"Hi everybody,

Following Russian's invasion of Ukraine, massive and coordinated sanctions have been imposed over Russia, in a lot of domains including the crucial energy sector.

Despite initial reluctance of some European countries which rely on Russian energy (Germany for instance), ban of oil and gas have been decided and US & European countries are now deploying massive efforts to remove this dependence (EU is dealing with middle-east gas, and US is even considering dealing again with Venezuelan oil).

&#x200B;

However, up to now the Russian mining industry has not been sanctioned yet.

Mining industry is a huge sector in Russian economy with groups such as Rusal (6% of world aluminum production) or Norilsk Nickel (20% of world nickel production, 75% of world palladium production). Furthermore these groups are controlled by Russian oligarchs who have not been sanctioned yet neither.

These groups provide a huge source of income for Russia, and sanctions could be very effective.

Now that bans have even been imposed on the Russian energy sector (and despite that has been said before on these bans, alternatives are being/have already been found to replace Russian energy sources), what could prevent the same to be applied on mining sector ?

&#x200B;

Is there a possibility that this sector is kept for future sanctions to make them effective ? I barely see every Russian sector being banned (even the main ones), except for this single one industry.

&#x200B;

Here is my thoughts in case of ban on Russian metals :

* Metals with high Russian markets shares (nickel, palladium…) will spike due to :
   * Supply shorts caused by the sudden removal of large amount of Russian metals from the market
   * Unchanged and strong demand (for instance, nickel is necessary for battery production, metallurgy, chemical industry and aeronautics, and demand is expected to have a substantial growth in the next years to support energy transition)
* By consequence, investors (and sectors mentioned above which need these metals to pursue their activities) will actively look for short and long-term alternatives to replace Russian metals and make the supply satisfy the demand
* This could highly benefits to some non-Russian sources such as VALE, BHP, RIO, TMC (the last one is an example of smaller cap but with a huge potential source of nickel in the future).

These stocks could be great opportunities in case of sanction and surge on nickel/palladium/copper price.

120,1214,Those who are bearish on TSLA what are your main talking points?,Company Discussion,"I personally am very bullish on TSLA and believe that it has a 90% chance of becoming the next biggest company in the world by 2030. From what I see, no company can produce EVs as cheaply, as high quality and as many as Tesla (not even Chinese EVs). They have the trifecta of manufacturing and EVs are still in the early adoption phase. Legacy auto makers have stagnant evaluations for the last decade.

Tesla is also the current leader in FSD technology, although it has a long way to go, growth in AI is exponential and we will get there eventually within a reasonable time frame. Tesla is going to be more of a robotaxi company than a car company. The economic gain of robotaxis is going to be insane, cars sit idle 95% of the time any decent economist will tell you that is money being lit on fire. If they can reduce that to just 70% idle, it will result in at least a trillion saved by not requiring a driver, increased speed of traffic, reduced accidents, and most importantly (in US and Canada) not being financially burdened by owning a car just to name a few.

It is more correct to say a Tesla revolution than an EV revolution. I did my research on TSLA back in mid 2021 and I strongly believe that today, in terms of information available and TSLA financials, is the best time to invest because there is very little uncertainty.

103,251,Looking at gamma levels for the upcoming expirations for $GME,Technical Analysis," Hi guys, I wanted to take a look at the upcoming options chain for $GME before Monday and see how it would affect next week and what we need to look out for and the levels we need to break to continue this massive rally. I'll also be looking at historical data that also point to another bullish week coming up.

All data found is scraped from various sources and are subject to change based on options buying and selling

What is Gamma and how does it affect the price?

Gamma is the rate of change in delta, Delta is the amount of underlying MMs need to hedge their options positions (assuming that MMs are hedging correctly). So a Gamma ramp would cause a massive increase in delta and MMs would then need to buy a massive amount of underlying stock the stay correctly hedged.

[Gamma levels for the 4\/1 and 4\/8 expiry](https://preview.redd.it/mu9wgy6f1tp81.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccf43dcde31fd11e8c7d3d52e04bd74c1c645d5c)

As you can see we have huge notional gamma at the 150, 160, and 200 levels. As demonstrated last week 160 was a pretty big resistance level for us, usually retail would sell their call options as they edge near the money however with such a big push for option exercising I could see that we push straight through these resistances, especially for T+1 options settlement on Tuesday. Looking at the rest of the chain after we push through 160 there are no real resistances until we hit the 200 level so If we break 160 I expect 200 is very likely after.

(As more options are bought and sold gamma levels can change and we could see a change in the chain)

Huge open interest on the 200 and 265 strikes and as the price nears these strikes the gamma would increase exponentially, especially for very OTM strikes causing a huge upswing in positive delta and MM buying. It would also cause the negative delta on the puts to be unwound and cause buying pressure as the MMs unhedge those puts that are now OTM.

We also have historically greater returns at the beginning of the week than later so especially with options settlement we could see a very explosive Tuesday and Wednesday.

45,1259,Will the Fed raise rates by 50 basis points in May?,Discussion,"The Federal Reserve released the minutes of its monetary policy meeting today. The Fed disclosed details of its plan to shrink its balance sheet. Given that U.S. inflation is at a 40-year high, the market expects the Fed to accelerate the process of shrinking its balance sheet. At the same time, the market will also pay attention to the clues that the Fed will raise interest rates further.

Shrink the table process or speed up

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March FOMC meeting that there would be ""a more detailed discussion"" of the $8.9 trillion balance sheet. At that meeting, the Fed announced its first rate hike since 2018.

Market expectations are that the Fed may shrink its balance sheet faster this time than it did in 2017-2019.

California Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday that the balance sheet reduction process could begin as early as May, and much faster than in 2017. It is reported that during the quantitative tightening period from 2017 to 2019, the Fed began to reduce assets by $10 billion per month, and gradually increased the cap to $50 billion per month after a year.

https://preview.redd.it/t53ykk0xqzr81.jpg?width=838&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f12325e3fbd99d515cd0f222f11c9310dbef250

Fed officials only stopped buying bonds last month as soaring inflation accelerated plans to trim the balance sheet, seen as a passive way to tighten monetary policy in tandem with raising interest rates.

""They're going to have a comprehensive plan,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC. ""They want to be ready to announce it in May. With inflation so high, it's become a pressing issue. .""

Economists say the reduction in the asset cap could amount to $100 billion a month, or about $1 trillion a year. JPMorgan's Michael Feroli estimates the caps for Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at $60 billion and $30 billion respectively, Krishna Guha of evercore ISI expects $50 billion and $30 billion, and Deutsche Bank estimates $50 billion and $30 billion, respectively. $60 billion and $45 billion.

With inflation already at its highest level since 1982, the Fed's tapering is likely to peak relatively quickly.

Aneta Markowska, chief U.S. financial economist at Jefferies LLC, said it could be ""a very short phase, two months, and there's really no need for a long-term phased in.""

There is a high degree of uncertainty about the economic impact of shrinking the balance sheet. Powell said shrinking the balance sheet ""could amount to another rate hike."" The FOMC has committed to using interest rates rather than assets as its primary monetary policy tool.

Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said: ""They do prefer raising rates as their primary tool for tightening. The Fed will make balance sheet adjustments if necessary, but for now wants to focus on rates.""

The asset reduction would be the Fed's latest attempt to ease inflationary pressures. In March, the Fed raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 0.25% to 0.5%. For the past two years, the Fed has kept borrowing costs near zero to insulate the economy from the impact of the outbreak.

The Fed's dot plot shows officials expect the median benchmark rate to be around 1.9% at the end of 2022 before rising to 2.8% in 2023.

While details of the balance sheet reduction were the focus of the meeting minutes, investors will also be carefully looking for clues on whether the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points in May. Powell said on March 22 that he was willing to raise interest rates further at the May meeting if necessary. Other policymakers have since expressed the same sentiment.

""I think a 50 basis point rate hike will be discussed, with at least 'several' or 'many' players open to raising rates in the coming months,"" Markowska said.",txz2xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/txz2xd/will_the_fed_raise_rates_by_50_basis_points_in_may/,NEGATIVE,0.9985983967781068

——

But oh ya, inflation is only happening because the ships and ports and all that jazz. Definitely not also because of the largest instance of debt monetization in the history of mankind.

This behavior jeopardizes the USD’s status as the reserve currency of the world.


Edit: Not saying that expanding the money supply is the only factor driving inflation. Supply chain issues, as we’ve been experiencing, increases inflation. Supply chain issues + expanding the money supply makes inflation even worse; it exacerbates inflation. I’m also not saying it was a bad thing for the Fed to respond as quickly and vigorously as they did. I do, however, think it was a mistake to add 2 trillion more to their balance sheet from August 2020 until now, amid increasing demand pressures and supply shortages. They kept adding to their balance sheet, expanding the money supply, even as the US made it through the eye of its economic storm.

I also chose 401ks as a reference point to compare against. 9 trillion is hard to conceive of. Thought that a unit of comparison would help. Other comparisons. US GDP = approx. 25 trillion. California GDP = approx. 3.5 trillion. Texas GDP = approx. 2 trillion. NY GDP = approx. 2 trillion. Florida GDP = approx. 1.2 trillion. GDP of UK = 3 trillion. GDP of Germany = 4 trillion.

80,2629,Recover Bajaj Finance IEPF Unclaimed Shares,Discussion,"The IEPF was established by the Government of India to solve the growing problem of people forgetting their shareholdings in a firm. This initiative was established to defend investors' interests and raise awareness among them.

All iepf unclaimed shares & iepf unclaimed dividends and lost shares sent to IEPF on behalf of lawful shareholders are handled by the government. The biggest reason why shares go iepf unclaimed shares year after year is that individuals forget they hold them! How can anyone overlook their own investments?

***Here are some of the reasons why this occurs!***

* Investors frequently fail to select a candidate for their shares. The heirs are unaware of any such ownership. Finally, the shares are abandoned.
* Because the amount invested in shares is little, investors tend to overlook it.
* In certain situations, the shares become embroiled in legal processes as a result of property disputes. In such cases, the shares stay ownerless until the ultimate court decision.

**Before IEPF**

Whenever the IEPF was not implemented, firms contributed iepf unclaimed shares iepf unclaimed dividends and shares to government funds. This money was utilised by the government for a variety of public welfare programmes. The monies were also utilised for a number of development projects.

Subsequently, the government recognised the heavy losses incurred by investors and decided to establish the IEPF. This functioned as a forum for investors to contact the government in order to claim their payouts. They can even get their long-forgotten shares refunded. The IEPF allowed investors to obtain dividends and shares directly from the fund management. All they had to do was make an application to the controlling authority. Instead of contacting each firm separately, people may now claim their dividends and shares from several companies through a single site.

## IEPF Unclaimed Shares & [IEPF Unclaimed Dividend](https://muds.co.in/recovery-shares-iepf/) Transferred to IEPF

***So, what happening to the shares and dividends that have been transferred to the IEPF? Will investors lose their rights to their iepf unclaimed dividends and*** [***iepf unclaimed shares***](https://muds.co.in/recovery-shares-iepf/)***?***

The dividend sum and shares were handed to the government prior to the creation of the IEPF. As a result, a shareholder lost all rights to the dividend money. The establishment of the IEPF enabled owners to retain control over the dividend amount and shares transferred to the IEPF Account. A simple application to the IEPF's fund management will assist in keeping these privileges.

Reputable firms, such as Bajaj Finance Ltd., send individual letters, by post, and through numerous other forms of contact to inform shareholders of their stake in the company. Their staff will remind stockholders to file their dividend claims on time. Once shares have been moved to the IEPF, the procedure of reclaiming them may become difficult.

The fund manager's entire refund procedure is time-consuming. To guarantee that the reimbursement reaches the correct owner, all applications are thoroughly reviewed. As a result, Bajaj Finance Ltd. advises shareholders to collect the dividend directly from the firm. The procedure is simple and quick. To claim dividends, shareholders must submit an application to the Company's Registrar or Transfer Agent.

If the shares have already been transferred to the IEPF, simply approach the company's Nodal Officer. You can contact the appropriate authority through email.",u2knsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/u2knsd/recover_bajaj_finance_iepf_unclaimed_shares/,NEGATIVE,0.9966993927955629

170,1248,Aercap’s (AER) 3.5b loss of aircraft to Russia could pop the “aircraft leasing bubble”:,Company Analysis,"Aercap, the world’s largest aircraft leasing company, has submitted an insurance claim for 3.5 billion worth of aircraft and engines that Russia refuses to return.

However, even if they do get the entire insurance claim (unlikely as the claim is going to be fought in court, Loyds of London suggests they should get 10 to 15% https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2022/03/30/660380.htm ) this loss is about much more than the assets/planes themselves.

It reflects a change in how Aercap will be able to do business.

Aercap acts as a “middleman” between investors who offer capital to buy aircraft, aircraft manufacturers, and airlines. However, their unprecedented loss almost certainly means an end of the cheap debt and cheap insurance payments they rely on. 

Aircraft leasing is relatively new over the past 40 years. The number of commercial aircrafts that are leased from a leasing company has grown from 1.7% to 51% of total aircrafts ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095749/share-leased-aircraft-aviation-industry-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095749/share-leased-aircraft-aviation-industry-worldwide/)). 

The growth of this industry is largely based on the Cape Town Treaty ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape\_Town\_Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town_Treaty)), a treaty where all signatory countries agree that that they will facilitate the repossession of assets like planes, trains, farm equipment etc to the original state.  

By stealing foreign aircrafts, Russia has broken this treaty, showing that leasing aircrafts is much more risky than previously understood. 

Aercap is highly indebted, owing about as much as it owns in assets (74.5 billion in debts, 74.6b in assets *(before the Russian loss)*. They require access to cheap loans in order to facilitate their position as a middleman between bond investors and airlines. They say so themselves: 

“We have incurred a substantial amount of debt to complete the GECAS Transaction, \[most recent 30B bond/loan offering\] which has significantly increased our indebtedness and debt service obligations, increasing risks relating to our substantial level of indebtedness” (2021 q4 earnings FORM 20-F, p 6).

**“**To service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available” (FORM 20-F, p 7). 

“Despite our substantial indebtedness, we might incur significantly more debt” (FORM 20-F, p 7).

At the time of borrowing the 30b, before the Russian loss, the company had a  MSCI ESG Rating of “A.” This was largely because investors bought into the Cape Town Treaty, seeing planes as assets that are really hard to lose. After Russia stealing the planes, the chances of AerCap ever being able to borrow money again at such a cheap price seems unlikely. 

The same is true for their insurance costs, both the type of insurance AER will have to buy (in order to avoid a similar situation now where they have to fight the claims in court) along with the the increase in premiums to reflect the risk means that their overhead will increase significantly. 

All this means a significant increase in overhead costs in an industry that relies on high amounts of debt.

* Higher interest rates can also lead to a drop in the stock market, primarily due to it costing businesses more money to operate 
* Last week. the FED raised intertest rates last  for the first time in over 3 years, and warned of 11 more interest rate increases to come.  
* If you have a credit card, auto loan, student loan or mortgage, they are going to become more expensive  if you have variable interest rates. 
*  Student loan payments are also scheduled to restart after May 1, 2022, so your payments will increase as rates increase 
* Also, interest rates will increase for those who plan to borrow student loans, mortgages or auto loans in the future
* The FED hopes that by making it more expensive to borrow money, there will be less demand to borrow money for homes, cars and other goods that we borrow money for 
* Interest rates would increase by about the same amount as the Fed hike, usually within one to two billing cycles. 
* The rationale is, because it costs more to borrow, fewer people can afford things, so spending pulls back 
* The FED’s hope is that this will help slow down inflation, which, is at its highest levels since 1982 
* Policymakers estimate that 7 more interest rate increases will happen this year, bringing rates to around 2% by year end 
* They also expect 4 additional hikes in 2023, to bring the interest rate near 3%.

The largest winner then was Halliburton because of their connection to VP Dick Chenney. After Halliburton it was Bechtel Group. Does Biden/Obama/Harris/Pelosi have any similar conflicts of interest where they might direct funds for rebuilding?

>However, dozens of lower-profile, but well-connected, companies shared in the reconstruction bounty. . . . Nearly 60 percent of the companies had employees or board members who either served in or had close ties to the executive branch for Republican and Democratic administrations, for members of Congress of both parties, or at the highest levels of the military. . . . The three agencies that awarded most of the Iraq and Afghanistan contracts in 2002 and 2003—the Pentagon, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. It found that nearly every one of the 10 largest contracts awarded for Iraq and Afghanistan went to companies employing former high-ranking government officials or individuals with close ties to those agencies or Congress. . . . Indeed, most of the companies that won contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan were political players. According to the Center’s analysis, the companies, their political action committees and their employees contributed a total of nearly $49 million to national political campaigns and parties since 1990. . . .The Center’s investigation found that 14 of the contractors were awarded U.S. government work in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Combined, those companies gave nearly $23 million in political contributions since 1990, and 13 employ former government officials or have close ties to various agencies and departments.

We need to do an analysis of contributions to the Dems and Biden administration and, ideally, Macron, Scholz, and other E.U. players. Do the Bidens have any connections to construction or manufacturing companies in Ukraine *à la* Burisma?

# TLDR:

*Technicals*: $ G M E is at a 46.1% discount to its 15-month technical fair value. $ T L R Y is at a 74.9% discount. Evidence was presented via Ortex that $ G M E short-borrow utilization is still 100% (34 days now), a cost to borrow as high as 40%, with now an insidious 25% short-interest of the float, and a 188% rise in short interest over four months. These stocks were together placed in 30+ ETFs, which were then the targets of mass-short-sale attacks. These ETFs, such as XRT, have short interest % of the float around 1,250.00%, indicating a risk of termination of these ETFs based on their prospectus, upon any rise in price of the stock(s), thereby indicating that hedge funds have taken irresponsible levels of risk in their selling and lending of shares that they do not own. This places even more pressure on hedge funds to buy these meme stocks in order to cover their now-historic short-borrow liabilities.

*Statistical Correlations of 'Meme-Stocks'*: It was revealed that the MemeStock 'labeling' and/or 'targeting' mechanism ('Meme-Stock' was a purposeful theme applied by hedge funds and the mainstream media in order to classify stocks liked by younger generations of investors) has now led to a high 97% statistical R correlation in all 'Meme-Stock' charts. $ G M E and $ T L R Y share this correlation, as evidenced. Nevertheless, this 'Meme-Stock' phenomenon effectively makes all of them the 'same' stock, with market caps that jointly fluctuate with or without news from either of them. Therefore, as yet another risk to hedge funds who have egregiously sold $ G M E short: increases in the market caps of cannabis 'Meme-Stocks,' such as $ T L R Y, do apply substantial margin capital risks to 'Meme-Stock' short-sellers who remain At Large in our once-free stock market.  The preponderance of the evidence reveals that *their short positions only grew last week*, even though $ G M E rose 100% and $ T L R Y rose 70%.

171,1252,Zoom analysis and valuation - The winner of the pandemic is back to reality ($ZM) value $78 vs price $116,Company Analysis,"Zoom's share price went wild from around $70 prior to the pandemic to its all-time high of over $550! What followed after that was a decline of around 80% (Now trading at $116/share).

This post is an attempt to provide some information behind the volatility, the irrational stock price movement as well as to value Zoom as a company, today.

**What is Zoom?**

If I have to describe Zoom in one sentence, that would be ""A company that provides a communication platform"".

Yes, there are different packages that it offers, different features and offerings (Zoom meetings, Phone, Events & Webinar, Rooms, etc), but it all goes back to solving one problem --> How can individuals remain connected and collaborate when physically not close to each other?

**The IPO**

In the case of Zoom, I do believe that going back to April 2019 is important. The IPO is an important event as it allows the company to raise funds from the public so it can continue expanding its operations and also allow the initial investors to exit and make a return on their initial investments.

The determination of the IPO price is not a process that is done within minutes. It takes a lot of time and takes into account a lot of factors, not from a valuation point of view, but also from a pricing standpoint. In the end, the goal of the management (often time with some investment bank) is to figure out, what is the highest price that the public will pay?

The IPO price was set at $36/share. On the first day of trading, it went up to $66/share, almost double. What does this mean? The public was either:

1. Paying a premium and seeing Zoom as a company that's less risky than the average company on the market; or
2. Had higher expectations of Zoom than the management of Zoom (Otherwise they would've set the IPO price at $66/share)

**The financial performance**

The company's revenue grew from $331m in 2018 to:

\- $623m in 2019 (up 88%)

\- $2.7b in 2020 (up 325%)

\- $4.1b in 2021 (up 55%)

This growth is not something that we have seen that often and the pandemic was the main impact of it. However, the forecast for the next year is roughly 10% and that's not surprising.

Every individual/organization that needed Zoom or any other platform of this kind, well, they have become customers. The expansion ahead is very limited and there might be a reversal in terms of the number of customers. Schools for example would not need Zoom as much when everyone goes back there physically.

At the same time, the operating margin expanded from 2% to 26%. 

On one side, their gross margin decreased due to the increased demand. In order to provide the service on short notice, the direct costs for Zoom increased. However, the main increase of the margin came from the reduction of Sales & Marketing costs as a % of the revenue. Back in 2018/2019, Zoom had to spend more (per $ in revenue) to reach potential customers. In 2020/2021, the customers would go to Zoom as they needed such a platform. So, although the Sales and marketing in absolute value increased (from $331m in 2018 to $1.1b in 2021), as a % of the revenue it decreased from 56% to 28%.

**The financial position**

If we take a look at the financial position, Zoom is a dream company for every investor. It has $5.9b in cash, short-term and long-term investments with no debt apart from the $40m capital leases.

The management has been authorized to use $1bn in the next 2 years for share buybacks.

**So, how much is Zoom worth?**

Of course, every valuation has certain assumptions:

**Revenue growth:** 10% in the next 5 years, then slowly decline to the risk-free rate by year 10.

**Operating margin**: To slowly improve to 28% (mainly due to increase in gross margin)

**Discount rate:** 7.93% - based on WACC (assuming a beta of 1)

Putting all of the numbers together, the value/share of Zoom is around $78, much lower than the current market price of $116.

Could be I wrong? Absolutely. Below is a table that calculates the fair value/share based on different assumptions about the revenue of the company in 10 years and the operating margin.

|Revenue / Op. margin|26%|28%|30%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|80% ($7.4b)|$67.6|$71.5|$75.4|
|108% ($8.5b)|$74.0|$78.5|$82.9|
|200% ($12.3b)|$94.5|$100.8|$107.0|
|250% ($140.4b)|$105.6|$112.8|$120.0|

If the company can grow the revenue by 250% (from $4.1b to $14.4b) in the next 10 years and improve the operating margin to 30%, Zoom could be fairly valued. Of course, that offers little to no margin of safety. 

**The market is irrational**

Let's not forget that the share price went all the way up to $550. In order to justify that, the company should've kept growing at 40-50% for the next decade! Is that feasible? I don't think so.

Often times we see price increases that cannot be justified with fundamental reasons, this is definitely one of those times.

What i find interesting is that Paramount + 2021 total revenue was $28B with a net income of $4.5B, market cap of $24.5B.  
  

On the other hand, Netflix has 2021 revenues of $29B and net income of $5B, market cap of $166B.

So if the revenues, net income are nearly identical between the two companies and paramount + is now outpacing netflix in subscribers, is it fair to say this is a very undervalued stock?

March 16 Meeting. (Summary)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We had a few hiccups when we saw the GDP no in the range b/w 2-3 and the FED funds rate for 2022 to 1.9. What that meant was 0.25X7 = 1.75% hike in 2022 + room for a 50 basis pt hike.

I have to say I was shocked, but then my boi J. Powell came in to the rescue. He was just not having it to see his and other senators portfolios go into red. Why would he ? They all bought calls for Q2 / Q3  2022. He was pretty adamant that the FED was in control of inflation. That guy talked me down like low GDP, no isn't that big of a deal considering we were coming out of a pandemic. He also assured me that balance sheet run-off was no such a big deal. What's getting a few trillions out of 28T of balance sheet.

I have to say it, guys. Powell has switched from ""Inflation is Transitory"" to ""Our Economy is very strong with tight labor market"".

Note : Guys don't forget Bullard and Waller are down for 50bps and Balance sheet runoff. Lets see next week with other speakers.

Aftermath of two camps

&#x200B;

[Camp A vs Camp B](https://preview.redd.it/kmq8hd2gsjo81.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a351864de2f54537f423a87f3710152dcbcb1659)

&#x200B;

We have now got ourselves into two situations :

Camp A) Either Powell has done things right by raising 0.25bps and he is not gonna rug pull us and be transparent about everything, so guys 

"" You can buy this dip ""

Camp B) Powell cannot bring this situation under control and then he will one day at one such meeting come out by surprising me (most probably September 2022) and sending my portfolio into recession territory that inflation can only be tamed by Paul Volckering us. So guys, you can chill out and spend time with friends and family. And later in Q4 you see signs of rug pulling, you can 

"" Short the market in Q4"" and then buy at -50%+ from ATH.

Or

""You can buy this dip, sell before september, short the market , and invest profits in -50% from ATH""

&#x200B;

So choose the camp you guys want. But i am not joining any such teams. Rather, i am looking at things from diff perspective ( i.e. THE BOND MARKET)

&#x200B;

[5 - 10 curves have been inverted. Q4 crisis ?](https://preview.redd.it/nc3vr5pwujo81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec7722287848818eb2ae7a23ef9ddc516276173)

&#x200B;

       What if J Powell made a policy error and we shouldn't have increased rates.
    
    Yes guys, you heard it first here. What if he made such error or he could just be bluffing about going on with an additional 6 rate hikes. Idk about you guys, but i am not feeling too optimistic about more than 4 rate hikes. The Curve is suggesting there is no room for another hike. Do it and you get an inverted curve (10 -2 yield curve) with banks giving chill statements like nothing happens when a curve inverts. 
    
    Also long term bond will sell off and since we are in +ve correlation with curve flateening even before mid cycle of rate hike then it means stock markets will drop with each rate hike increase. Add housing and mortage crisis on top of that. 
    
    
    
    J Powell wasn't too concerned about this in his FOMC remarks. But I am coz Powell lied to me about inflation, but curve hasn't till now. It could have been if Russian money was controlling it. But then we can also assume that the whole stock market is being manipulated.
    
    So it all depends on the data that will be coming out this year. Or powell could inject QE+ after 4 rate hike and once again skip recession by kicking the can down the road if inflation comes down by september.
    

So now that I have established my camp, and where I stand on this.  In no way means it means i am right 100%. It just means I have to sit tight and assess this situation by May 2022. My assumptions could be wrong and hence i will then have to switch to camp A or B. And i will take camp B all day coz i have been supporting it.

So campers of the B ( which most of my readers will be coz, i told you to ride exit liq or not and come back in q4 )  i am giving you a HW like any other senior manager of a hedge fund pass-on to their juniors.  

&#x200B;

But i am not that kind of guy. In fact, in the next post ( 2-3 weeks ) we shall have a great discussion where you throw punches at me, and I will land some right back at you. So come prepared.

Here are a few points you need to research.

&#x200B;

1) Is Russia going for a capture fest in Europe after Ukraine?

2) China abandoning Dollar system with Arab, Pak, India, Russia. Basically division of the world into Asia and EU + USA

3) China invades Taiwan and the battle for Sillicon chips. ( The next war would be fought with chips, not carriers )

4) Sovereign debt crisis. Debt/ GDP ( Start with Greece and then study current Russia and then USA bonds ) 

5) Financial Crisis. Find out which bank in Europe/USA is getting into default. ( Study Credit Suisse )

6) Gold Vs Equity ( My calculation says near dotcom )

7) Recession , Forgotten Depression, The Greater Depression.

8) Study investing in China and Hong Kong stock markets. 

9) Agricultural and Water Investing. 

10) Covid new variant

154,2293,"Thoughts On $RILY, $OPY, and $COWN?",Company Discussion,"I am currently looking at several financial conglomerates: B. Riley Financial (RILY), Oppenheimer Holdings. Cowen, and Jefferies Financial Group. These companies are all trading around the 3-5 P/E range, have gross margins over 80%, and strong growth in both sales and earnings.

Of these companies, I have been primarily looking at B. Riley Financial (RILY). Valuation wise, the company has 92% gross margins, 11% ROI, 25% profit margins. Riley is also growing its sales and profits extremely fast at annual growth rates of 67% and 56% in the past 5 years. At current prices, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 4.3% and a plan for $50 million in share buybacks was recently approved.

Insiders own a large portion of the company already at 27% and are still buying significant amounts of the stock. The management looks strong overall with the CEO being the founder and heavily invested in the company. It seems like he is aggressively pushing expansion through acquisitions.

One main downside to Riley is its debt which has grown quickly as the company has increased its acquisitions. Riley has $3.9 billion in cash with $4.2 billion in debt. The long-term debt/equity ratio is high at ~3. Additionally, a large portion of the company's sales and revenue growth is not organic and comes from acquisitions or from the shell company boom. Their revenues from some divisions are also very cyclical, such as underwriting and liquidations.

Oppenheimer Holdings (OPY) and Cowen (COWN) have better balance sheets but growth is slower and management is less invested. Cowen looks to be the more interesting of the two with 35% annual sales growth in the past 5 years and some recent insider buying. Both seem exposed to cyclic revenues with their involvement in IPOs and general market participation.

176,1725,Western Digital analysis and valuation - Is it time for a comeback? ($WDC),Company Analysis,"Western Digital is one of the companies that had terrible share price performance over the last 5 years, down over 40%.

This post is an attempt to understand the company's historical performance, how the company operates today, what's ahead of it, and finally, how much it is worth today.

&#x200B;

**What is Western Digital?**

In one sentence, this is a company that develops, manufactures, and provides data storage devices and solutions.

If there's one thing we know about data, it is that it keeps increasing, hence there's increased demand for solutions around it. These solutions are not only in personal computers and smart video systems, but in the last decade also in automotive, IoT, and various home applications.

So, we have a growing industry, yet, Western Digital's share price has declined from $80 to $50.

Attractive industries always attract more competitors. The higher the supply of products, the lower the price. Western Digital's sales experienced a huge drop during 2019 to $16.5b (compared to $20.6b the year before). The reason is oversupply and competition for flash-based products. 

It is worth mentioning that the innovation in this industry is very aggressive, so the value of the products is decreasing significantly when a new and better product is introduced. When faced with high competition and an oversupply of products, there's no option to defer the sale to a later point in time, as if that option is chosen, those products are likely to be sold at a loss.

&#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

The operating margin declined from 17.5% in 2018 to only 0.5% in 2019, all due to the drop in sales price and gross margin. Since then, the company started recovering. The operating margin increased to 2% in 2020, to 7.2% in 2021, and is up to 13.2% for the last twelve months.

If we measure the sales activities of the company through the cost of goods sold, it is quite clear that their activities didn't decline. The number of goods sold remained stable. The R&D as % of revenue remained stable and during the last 5 years, the company even reduced the SG&A from 25% to 20% of the total revenue.

However, one bad year was enough to cause fear among investors and question the ability of the company to innovate and stay on the top of its game. Although the company has been around for over 50 years, the innovation of new products is as important as it was on day 1.

&#x200B;

**Financial position**

During the last 5 years, there are a few points to be noted related to the financial position:

1. The cash position decreased from $5b to $2.5b. Not because they were losing money, but because of the following two points.
2. The debt decreased from $11b to $7b (excluding leases). This roughly means, they generated an additional $1.5b to pay down debt from their regular operations. (not to mention, up until 2020, they were paying dividends)
3. A slight increase in PPE - is always a good sign which means their capacities have increased.

So, if we compare the balance sheet 5 years ago and today, it is clear that the company is in a better position than it was. Yet, the share price is much lower.

&#x200B;

**What's next?**

If we take a look at the company's priorities, based on the investor presentation, they've noted three:

1. Reinvestment in the company - mainly through R&D - no doubt that this is the most important use of funds. If this is not done, there will be no profitable company to run in a few years.
2. Reduced debt - Although it is at an acceptable level, one of their priorities is to further reduce it.
3. Shareholder return (through Dividends/share repurchases) - The company was a dividend-paying company between 2013 and 2020. I would not be surprised if they start paying dividends again within 2 years.

The market size (both for flash-based products and HDD) is expected to grow at around 4-5% year over year and analysts are projecting double-digit revenue growth. This is in line with management's expectations for the next year.

However, taking the fact that the company is operating in a highly competitive industry, I do not feel comfortable forecasting double-digit growth after the next 12 months. 

&#x200B;

**Valuation - Key assumptions**

As the valuation is based on certain assumptions, here are mine:

**Revenue growth** \- 10% in the next 12 months, followed by 2.5% growth afterward (equal to the current risk-free rate)

**Operating margin** \- 13% for the next year, followed by 14%. Although the margin was over 17% in the past, and there's a chance the company will get back there, there's also a chance to encounter another bad year, such as 2019.

**Discount rate** \- 9% (Based on WACC)

**Outcome -** The company's fair value is $22.5b ($72.18/share) - slightly undervalued at the moment based on my assumptions

&#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are wrong?**

Based on my assumption, the company's revenue will grow by 37% in 10 years. However, I could be wrong.

So here are a couple of different scenarios related to the revenue and operating margin 10 years from now.

|Revenue / Op. margin|12%|14%|16%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|20% ($22.7b)|$55.3|$66.1|$76.9|
|37% ($25.2b)|$59.4|$72.2|$83.6|
|50% ($28.4b)|$62.3|$75.6|$88.9|
|100% ($37.9b)|$71.3|$88.5|$105.7|

In all of these scenarios, the company seems undervalued, in some more than others and it is quite clear that maintaining a high operating margin is more important than growing the revenue. If I am to invest in the company, I'll be more focused on the margins.

* 18.7 p/e ratio and 1.25% dividend. 
* Compared to Macy's (5.89 pe, no dividend) and Kohl's (9.79 pe, 1.61% dividend)

Some cause for optimism:

* WSJ predicts the supply chain issues will benefit discount stores, giving them lots of inventory to buy at cheap prices.
* Morningstars: ""Ross should be relatively well-insulated against digital rivals, considering its differentiated store experience and operational efficiency (which fuels its competitive prices).”
* If we go into a recession Ross should perform relatively well.

Some cons:

* Morningstars: Rising labor costs can strain margins, with asymmetric pressure relative to online rivals considering Ross' need to maintain in-store staff.

* ""Digital sellers are building distribution leverage, easing returns, and pricing aggressively, necessitating continued cost containment to fuel low prices while maintaining margins (particularly as the pandemic may increase e-commerce adoption long term).""

89,2863,When do you profit on an option order? (Breakeven price),Discussion,"I've been options trading for around 2 weeks now and have been doing relatively fine. (FOMC did me really nice yesterday) Although I have a question that I haven't quite figured out. This morning I had the idea to buy a TSLA 760 call with a breakeven price of around $871. I could have banked on this trade if I wasn't limited to the PDT flag although the swing didn't really worry me as the expiration for this contract is in April.

With that being said, here is my question. If I had bought the Call at $845 (B-E at $871) would I be making money on the entire climb up it made today? and if so then what is this breakeven price really talking about? I have made money on contracts even when they're not at their breakeven price.

68,2508,Is it time to look at nuclear energy - what are your best uranium ideas or supply chain plays?,Discussion,"The most overlooked advantage of uranium is that it provides a very low volatility (green) energy supply

\- Fuel represents only \~25% of energy generation costs (compared to >**75% for oil, gas & coal**)

\- Approximately half of that cost is related to enrichment, waste management, fabrication, etc., implying that uranium cost is <**15%** of the overall electricity generation cost

This implies very low demand elasticity to uranium prices, which means that the commodity price can increase significantly without impacting demand, which is very different than oil & gas, which are sensitive to changes in demand

It is incredible that with everything that is going on in Europe, Germany is scheduled to completely retire its nuclear plants by the end of this year.

Is it time for a nuclear renaissance ?

158,2416,RKT - Bull thesis,Company Discussion,"We’re nearing the end of a pretty nasty downtrend trend for Rocket Companies (RKT), but it may be time to consider buying in at these levels for a long position. I’d love feedback on my thesis below.

It’s no secret that the stock has struggled in the face of raising interest rates to combat inflation. It’s been looming over the stock since early 2021 (aside from when it meme’d). Now that we have a little more clarity from the FED on what we’re dealing with and how we’re gonna handle it, the next few years may actually be favorable for Rocket even if on the surface, they’ll be making less money than they did during the pandemic. 

I believe the competition will be way more affected by higher interest rates than RKT. This is a reality that all mortgage companies have to deal with. But RKT has deep pockets along with more diversification into other revenue streams to wait out slower periods. I believe there will be more consolidation in the mortgage industry in the next few years (we’re already seeking it with moves like Better.com, look that up if you haven’t seen that mess) and it’ll only help RKT obtain more market share. 

The execs at RKT have also been very savvy with acquisitions to grow their platform outside the traditional mortgage route. I predicted that they’d start acquiring companies about 3 months ago (see post history) and they bought Truebill (a 1.275 billion all cash deal) a few weeks after my post. They’re funneling tons of cash into advertising this app. I see adds EVERYWHERE for it (youtube ads, public transit, etc) and it’s a brilliant way to get users in the door/into the ecosystem for more service offerings. The user base growth is a story no one seems to be talking about. It will be key in the long run as they strive to obtain the most market share. I expect another major acquisition to be done by the end of 2022 at the latest. Jay Farner (CEO) stated that they’d be very aggressive this year to acquire companies as they become more appealing to buy with everything coming down from pandemic highs. 

And the cherry on top, Jay also stated that he plans to buy $36 million of his own stock throughout the year of 2022. The stock price of 10-11 seems to be an established floor with the worst news already known and behind us. The upside heavily outweighs any risks that I see but I’d love to hear any *constructive* negative theories that you may have (especially at these prices).

Position, 3600ish shares (dividend $ recently reinvested back into the stock, rounding) @ a 17 average. I’ll be buying calls soon as well. Preparing to buy call leaps by the end of the week. I expect this to be a 20 stock by 2023.",tsdmcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tsdmcw/rkt_bull_thesis/,NEGATIVE,0.7539981603622437
84,2676,How to Claim Shares from IEPF?,Discussion,"We'll help you reclaim your iepf claim or iepf unclaimed shares. Some of MUDS's most well-known services are listed below.

**How to claim shares from iepf?**

1. **Transmission of shares (iepf unclaimed shares)**

It is the act of transporting a share from the original owner to a claimant or legal heir by operation of law, for reasons such as insolvency, death, marriage, lunacy, or any other valid reason other than natural transfer.

The claimant or legal heir becomes the rightful holder of the shares after the shares are successfully transmitted. Individuals with such shares are also entitled to the rights that come with them.

***The conventional documentation for the transmission of shareholdings is listed below:***

* For stock transfer, there is a prescribed application form.
* a legitimate copy of the authentic holder's death certificate
* Letter of Administration, Probate of Will, or Succession Certificate
* Petitioner's signature, legal heir's signature, or successor's signature PAN copy 

1. **Transfer of shares is the second facility**

The intentional transfer of title of the claims between the transferor and the transferee is referred to as a transfer of shares. The transferor's liability vanishes after this process is completed, and the shares are routed to the recipient. The transfer deed is the instrument used in the transfer of shares.

1. **Transfer of unclaimed dividends is the third service** 

When a company makes a profit, the profit available to shareholders is referred to as dividends. The value of a dividend is determined by the number of shares a shareholder owns in the company. As previously stated, [iepf unclaimed shares](https://muds.co.in/recovery-shares-iepf/) **&** dividends are routed to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) account if they remain unclaimed for seven consecutive years. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has given shareholders the option of reclaiming such securities.

**What is the Investor Education and Protection Fund's function?**

The Investor Education and Protection Fund is a federal repository for unclaimed stock, dividends, and bonus issues. SEBI and MCA, for example, allow shareholders of such securities to recoup their losses through a well-defined protocol.

The recovery of securities can become a little more complicated in the case of common pitfalls, as mentioned above. As a result, holders of such securities should exercise caution or seek professional advice to ensure a smooth recovery.

**MUDS is a one-stop shop for top-notch legal and consulting services. Our professionals are tasked with providing clients with bespoke and high-quality services based on their needs.**

**Dematerialization OF Physical Shares**

The method of transforming physical assets into electronic form is known as the dematerialization. Because the transfer of physical shares is prohibited by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India), this makes the investments tradable. Investors face a variety of issues with physical investments, including signature mismatch, name change, and a variety of other issues, and we offer comprehensive solutions to all of these issues as well as assistance in dematerializing physical shares.

**Reclaiming Investments transferred to IEPF**

If shares, dividends, or mutual funds are not claimed for seven years in a row, they are transferred to the iepf claim. We specialise in assisting individuals in recovering their IEPF shares, and we have recovered millions of dollars in iepf claim  shares over the years.

Normally, the entire process of [iepf claim  share recovery](https://muds.co.in/recovery-shares-iepf/) takes a long time and effort, but with our expertise, we can complete it in the shortest time possible while also covering all of your unclaimed investments.",tvvvk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tvvvk1/how_to_claim_shares_from_iepf/,NEGATIVE,0.6710377335548401

Do people possibly not understand what this company does and how it makes money? They market all of the online gambling companies. They then get paid for all of the users that register and also then get a large percentage of the users gambling losses. This money keeps coming while the user keeps gambling and often lasts for many years. As more users sign up, this amount grows exponentially. The company made over €40 million last year and should easily make over €70 million this year. Due to exponential growth and the legalising of gambling in the U.S. this yearly turnover will keep increasing for at least the next 10 years.",tynq4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tynq4d/how_has_nobody_noticed_gamb/,NEGATIVE,0.5487366318702698
177,1835,The bear case against F,Company Analysis,"Ok I don’t have a short position but I always consider the bear case. It’s actually kind of fun to pick apart your own thesis.

So, here’s my thoughts about Ford and it’s pivot into EV.


The electric F150 is very cool. Who doesn’t like that? Give it a few years and will be the best selling pickup, no surprises there.

Now you might think that’s great! But think about it. Who’s customers would Ford be taking by having the best selling Pickup? 
Their own…

Yea they can probably steal some customers from other pickup manufacturers (even though they are also going EV mind you), but the main bulk of their customers is going to be their own existing customers who bought the gas version of the F150.
Now I’m not American and I don’t own a pickup, but there is probably a high level of fanboying about pickups as well. 


Ford isn’t challenging the EV market with the F150, it’s challenging the same old pickup market that it’s challenged for how many years now? 
And that brings me to another point, how long has Ford been around, 100 years or something? You’d get good odds at the bookies that F is gonna grow substantially any time soon.

But what about electric cars I hear you say!
Well I hear that, but all I see is much expensive retooling.
Startup EV companies have an advantage there, they don’t need to retool and retrain, they are fresh off the bat.

And then there is the dealership thing..


TDLR:
F looks like a value trap to me or worse, it has an ok dividend though if that’s your thing.
