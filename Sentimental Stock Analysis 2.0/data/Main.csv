This is going to blow your fucking mind but Wall Street Bets is a sub about making money. Despite how the memes have taken over, the entire idea here is we actually make money. Don't respond to this comment with a shitty joke about how your account is red or some dumb shit. If you have never seen green on your account, liquidate it right now, take your money out of banks, put it under pillows, and accept your loss to inflation because you are too dumb to function and handle money beyond the level of a caveman hoarding rocks.

Can we get a return to people actually making money, and actually having any idea whatsoever as to why they do the things they do...or even how a fucking option works. Jesus H tap dancing mother fucking Christ.

61,"I analyzed 2,000+ stock splits over the last 3 decades to see if you can make money from stock splits. Here are the results!",DD | GME,"Stock splits are all the rage - After Google announced in Feb that there would be a 20:1 stock split in July this year, Amazon has followed suit announcing a similar 20:1 split and sending the market into a frenzy. Amazon’s price was up by 6% the next day and Google’s stock rose more than 9% in after-market trading following the news. Tesla is also planning for a second stock split and most recently, GME has also announced its stock split.

We do know that stock splits do not affect the underlying business in any way, but it is undeniable that there is price movement around the announcement and execution of a stock split. So in this week’s analysis, let’s deep-dive into the world of stock splits, how and why they are executed, and most important… Is it possible to make money off of a stock split?

**What is a stock split and how is it executed?**

A stock split is a simple decision by the company board to increase (or in some cases decrease) the outstanding shares of the company. For example, let’s say you own 10 shares of company X worth $100 each. So in total, you own $1K worth of shares in the company. If the company announces a 2-for-1 stock split, now you will have 20 shares of the company worth $50 each. But the total value of shares you own in the company does not change. You will still own the same $1k (20 x 50) worth of shares that you started with.

If you are wondering why companies engage in stock splits, the following are some of the key reasons.

* **Affordability:** Sometimes the stock becomes too expensive for retail investors to buy into. Consider Amazon - One stock is worth close to $3k now. So the minimum amount you would need to start investing in Amazon is $3k which might not be affordable to a vast majority of retail investors \[1\] Also there is the psychological impact of buying a share worth $3k and a share worth $30.
* **Options:** For the options players, there is a huge difference when a stock is cheap. In options, a single contract is worth 100 shares. So for a covered call strategy incorporating Amazon, before stock split, you would need a single stock position worth more than $275K vs only \~$14K exposure after the said 20:1 stock split.
* **Liquidity:** Since more shares are outstanding for the company after the split, it will result in greater liquidity and a lesser bid-ask spread. It also allows the company to buy back their shares at a lower cost since their orders would not move up the share price as much, due to higher liquidity.

Now before we jump into the analysis, you should understand how exactly a stock split is executed. On **announcement day**, investors get to know that a stock split is going to happen soon. The stockholders eligible for the stock split are decided on the record date. This is mainly a formality. The actual split would happen on the **ex-split date (or ex-date)**. After this, the stocks would start trading at their new price. For example, in a 20:1 split, the stocks would trade at 1/20th the previous price after the ex-date. From our data, we observed that there was an average delay of 36 days between the announcement day and ex-split date.

**Data**

For this analysis, I have used the data from [Fidelity’s stock split calendar](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/conferenceCalls.jhtml?tab=splits) that tracks the announcements and execution of stock splits, from as far back as 1980! I have considered splits only from 1993 (due to stock price data availability), and I have considered only companies that currently have a market cap of $1Billion or above. I have also ignored reverse stock splits as the data is too small to be statistically significant.

This gives us a total of more than 2,000 stock splits to work with. In case you are interested in the raw data, I have shared both the raw data and analysis through links at the end \[2\]. 

**Returns**

As soon as a stock split is announced, there is bound to be a lot of buying and selling activity. The question is, how much return could you have seen? There are a few scenarios possible here.

**Short Term Returns**

The short term plays possible around stock splits are:

1. You already own the stock and see its price go up on announcement day.
2. You did not own the stock on the announcement day so you buy the stock just before the actual stock split execution.

https://preview.redd.it/j7ujpf1y2is81.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=60912ef1adabca10f9f857da0321abf1363f705a

As expected, the announcement of a stock split sends the stock pumping with a 1.48% 2-day return when compared to only 0.09% return generated by SPY during the same time period. You would still have beaten the market if you had bought the stock one day before the actual split execution day and then held it for two days (albeit by much less - 1/7th of the gains you would have made if you had owned it before the announcement).

**Long Term Returns**

Considering that a stock split is supposed to indicate growth prospects, what happens when you hold for a longer time? There are two possibilities:

1. You buy the stock just after the announcement of the split
2. You buy the stock on the split execution date.

https://preview.redd.it/51513s603is81.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ed4a28a5e57254549e79a65ccd952219eea34a

Buying just after the announcement would have paid off handsomely with the returns beating the market easily in the long run. On average you would have had an alpha of 1.5% over the market in just over a month.

But, on the other hand, if you buy it on the day of the split, the returns are not that great. You would have lost money in the first week on average and would have been underperforming SPY even over the period of one month. You would have had to wait about a year for your portfolio to overtake SPY. This is to be expected because by the time of the actual split, the hype has died down a bit and the rallies in price are a bit more uncertain.

**What about H\*DLers?**

This is another interesting case where you would have bought stocks on their announcement date or ex-split date and held on till today, starting from 1993 \[3\]. Though most people wouldn’t trade by this strategy, it’s interesting to see how it would have fared. \[4\]

https://preview.redd.it/n6i7py113is81.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=c74d9f2afdcb64f342300dd6c6bb0169f208a58c

If you had bought all stocks that underwent a split and held till today, you would have beaten the S&P 500 by close to 200%!

**How certain are our returns?**

Next, we have to look into whether the alpha we are seeing here is due to a few stocks that are skewing the results. Even though I have capped for outliers, I wanted to know what % of stocks undergoing a split beat the market over the different time periods that we just saw.

https://preview.redd.it/w4506by13is81.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd95395be1c8e00bb00ea578eea899d756fe635

Well, would you look at that! Except in one case, the odds would be in your favor to beat the market if you had followed this strategy. As expected, for short term the highest chance is if you had owned the stock before the announcement (which is not realistic), but even if you had bought it one day after the announcement, you would have had almost a 60% chance of beating the market by the actual execution day.

**The cheap and the expensive**

The usual rationale behind a stock split is that the stock has become too over-priced, and splitting it makes it cheaper for retail investors to buy into - But the data revealed some contrary insights. Over 90% of the stocks were less than $52 in value at the time of the split, and only 5% were over $230 in value!

So obviously, the question is - **Was there an advantage to buying cheaper stocks or more expensive stocks at the time of a split**, and how did they compare to the total set and the benchmark?

The 10 percentile value for the adjusted close at the time of announcement was $3.50 (203 stocks less than this value), and the 90 percentile value was around $43 (203 stocks more than this value). Here are the average returns for these sets.

https://preview.redd.it/hzenccz23is81.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=4debdb20bdedbd1c9b06aa887de2acb8c5ee5569

The lower-priced stocks seem to have a massive advantage in almost all respects, sometimes giving a return of more than twice the complete set of splits in the long term! On the other hand, the higher-priced stocks have a poor record - Though they beat the benchmark in the short term\[5\], in the long term, their performance is much lower than the stocks having a lower price.

One of the reasons that the lower-priced stocks have such a high average is because stellar companies like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Nike, etc. were trading for less than 5 dollars per share in the 90s - But this doesn’t invalidate the observation. There were stocks trading for more than 100s of dollars around the same time, and they didn’t do as well as the lower-priced stocks. This insight could mean that ***companies with a lower share price that go for a stock split now have a higher possibility of growth than huge stocks*** like Amazon or Google.

**Limitations**

The analysis seems to indicate that stock splits are a sure-shot buy. But there are some caveats to keep in mind before trying to replicate this:

1. There are a variety of large, mid, and small-cap stocks that underwent stock splits. Comparing the returns solely to the S&P 500 might not be the most ideal way to calculate Alpha since the S&P 500 comprises of the biggest 500 companies in the U.S. So the alpha we are seeing here might just be compensating for the extra risk we are taking buying into smaller companies.
2. The stock splits selected here are companies that have a market cap of at least $1Billion.

**Conclusion**

Buying and holding stocks at the time they are undergoing a split might not be an outrageously successful strategy - But it definitely has an edge, both in the short term and especially in the long term. This gives some credence to the statement that a stock split indicates good prospects of growth.

And if you’re wondering whether the right time to buy is during the announcement or the actual split, the data shows that **there is a clear advantage to buying around the time of the announcement**, especially for short-term plays. The probability of success is also 60% and above in many cases, indicating that there is something more to this than mere chance.

And finally, stocks with a smaller price seem to do much better than stocks with higher prices when it comes to stock splits. While this could just be the compensation for the risk you are taking investing in smaller companies, it’s definitely worth looking into!

**Data:** All the raw data for the stock splits and returns for additional time periods that I could not showcase in this article [**can be found here.**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/stock-splits-data-6LUbbrOfFLo2cjV25RoXaQ/live)

**Footnotes**

\[1\] Along similar lines, to own a single Class A share of Berkshire Hathaway, you need $489K. There are some theories that certain companies have very high share prices because they don’t want retail investors (who are usually fickle in ownership) to own their stock. This usually leads to lesser volatility for the said stocks. One other point to consider here is that there are more and more brokers who are offering fractional shares these days. So stock splits might not be as relevant as it was before.

\[2\] This should make your life much easier as we had to use web scraping to pull all the data.

\[3\] Walmart split its stock [11 times](https://stock.walmart.com/investors/stock-information/dividend-history/default.aspx) on a 2-for-1 basis between their IPO in October 1970 and March 1999. An investor who bought 100 shares in Walmart’s IPO would have seen that stake grow to 204,800 shares over the next 30 years!

\[4\] In fact, [there was an ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TOFR/)that bought stocks that were going for 2:1 stock splits.

84,💲 G M E 💵 Overcoming Routine Technical 'Technicalities' to Remain 'Jacked',Technical Analysis,"# Market Price Action

It's just a Tuesday, yet today's Market Price for 💲 **G M E**  touched upon $448,950.00 per share according to a screenshot of the highest 'last' price (2 shares), at least $510.00 per share according to options triggers, $370.00 per share according to some charts, $275.00 per share according to a transactional verification, while only obtaining $200.00 per share according to nominal 'lit' exchange data.  Let's analyze today's activity:

&#x200B;

[💲 G M E Price Action from this morning reveals outsized, acute demand for the stock - Although separate evidence suggests that $448,950.00 was obtained today per share \(2 shares\), this move triggered in-the-money notifications for what were out-of-the-money options, with investors with call options as high as $510.00 - Note that the 15-month high from pre-market on 28JAN2021 was $508.04 \(moments before the buy-button was removed that morning\), indicating that 💲 G M E is 'seeking' its free-economic-market price which may be above $508.04 or $510.00 per share](https://preview.redd.it/ifov1cwc4dq81.jpg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46735e04aa9b732a880e7eebe797625e8d097949)

&#x200B;

![img](gq2197to4dq81 ""Further, evidence shows that there were 💲 G M E  market transactions significantly above the current 'lit' price : in this case, $275.00 per share today. 
Many investors are sharing screen shots of extreme prices above $510.00 in-the-money shortly before facing a downward [as opposed to an upward] limit halt"")

&#x200B;

# Technicalities

&#x200B;

[ This morning, 💲 G M E experienced a \\""routine\\"" volatility trading halt - The ticker ran up in the first five minutes after the open, before being brought down, in an orchestrated fashion that was likely designed to 'attempt to induce panic selling' - At 9:37:30 a.m. EST the stock was hit by a mysterious onslaught of superhigh-frequency 100-share-block-short-sells - One can observe the mass-coordinated 182.79 share sales, the next order a few pennies below this coordinated wall triggered the limit-down halt - This NYSE halt for a few minutes removed investors ability to freely invest. The fact that this same price action with exact timings took place with 💲 A M C reveals that this was an ETF-induced maneuver via the 'Meme-Stock' basket - The halt was followed by some consolidation - Contrary to the likely intent of the maneuver, 💲 G M E 'overcame' with a price recovery in less than one investing hour](https://preview.redd.it/r9cuito1wfq81.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=671c5df378cb65f70d45c1506284d9158dc9bd56)

&#x200B;

As displayed above, today, Hedge Funds abused their market function to purposefully and successfully *exploit* the Limit-Up-Limit-Down ([LULD](https://www.luldplan.com/)) protective-feature of the New York Stock Exchange.  This created a few minute pause in investing that served to attenuate investing.  The original spirit of that rule is to serve as a 9:45 am EST market halt feature that mitigates volatile and disorderly investing.  There was nothing disorderly about a 7% increase in the 'lit' exchange price.  But, the halt mysteriously took place earlier than it's supposed to: at 9:37 a.m. EST.  In speculation of their motive and technique, by Hedge Funds assisting the 5-minute rise on the buy side (thereby dragging up the average price), they then forced the price down with high-frequency short-sales (thereby quickly triggering the 5% volatility down limit).

💲 **G M E**  investors who owned the stock through January 2021, when mainly limit-up halts were experienced multiple times per trading day, have classified this price action as '*routine*' and '*part of the game*.'  Investors should be aware, however, that Hedge Fund(s) intentional manipulation of a security like this - in order to force a market halt - does constitute a gross violation of securities laws, as it is arbitrary and capricious behavior within markets, as well as abuse of the good-faith market function of a Hedge Fund.  On the other hand, for the rightful investors of this company, who intend on long term company ownership, these minute-long declines could be viewed as 'acute discounts,' allowing for faster ownership of the company per dollar.  This is especially so, theoretically, if the investor then utilizes those free discounts and is more readily able to remove the earned share from DTCC market 'lending' and 'locates' circulation by registering their newly-acquired-artificially-discounted shares directly with the transfer agent.

This pause did prevent investors from being able to freely transact for a few minutes, and may have been a technique for the Hedge Fund(s) involved to not only ""buy more time,"" but to make a quick jolt of profit.  It is also possible that these funds were well aware of the timing of such a manuever, and were perhaps given a 5-minute window to make transactions before they manipulated the price downward (creating a short duration but high magnitude 'pump' and 'dump').  Similar 'short-ladder attacks' also occurred today at 2:56 p.m. EST and 3:37 p.m. EST.  Performing three outsized 'short-ladder attacks' in one business day, while unable to harm the price nor adversely attenuate the natural demand for the stock, in-all-likelihood has even further substantially increased Hedge Funds' short-borrow liabilities.  We would be able to observe this using tomorrow's live Ortex data.  But, let's look at today's available data:

# Recent Fundamental Developments

Increased demand seems to be growing for 💲 **G M E**  based on new fundamentals, as listed below:

&#x200B;

* 💲 **A M C**   CEO Adam Aron has expressed interest in expanding the company to be more of a global investing company, with intent to expand further, and having recently acquired a major stake in Hycroft Gold Mining Company
* 💲 **A M C**  experienced success with the movie 'Batman,' and showed success not only with its digital-asset payments for movie tickets, but with dynamic pricing
* 💲 **G M E**  Chairman Ryan Cohen, among other insiders, have purchased daily droves of raw shares of the company.  In the case of the chairman, his ownership has grown to 11.9%
* 💲 **G M E**  has a newfound digital-asset marketplace (with an art example, see below) that is not only in beta, but it is already collecting *transaction revenues*
* 💲 **G M E**  as evidenced from legal spokespeople on twitter (yet to be officially verified), may have recruited Keith Gill, also known as Reddit User DeepFuckingValue, as a company employee to take charge of various roles.  Further evidence is needed to verify this claim.

# Conclusion

1. Data shows that 💲 **G M E**  touched upon $448,950.00 per share, $510.00 per share, $370.00 per share, $275.00 per share, and $200.00 per share today.  This may seem confusing, but in reality, there are two types of exchanges: those we can see ('lit') and those we cannot ('dark pools').  It appears that off-exchange ('dark pool') prices went ""to the Moon"" today before a down-limit volatility halt was purposefully-induced (via an orchestrated maneuver by hedge funds where shares were expelled onto the market in superhigh-frequency block trades, 52,200 of which were of the same exact price of $182.79).  💲 **G M E**  investors referred to their observation of this type of attack as '*routine*.'  Just prior to this maneuver, in-the-money notifications of significantly out-of-the-money options were triggered above $510.00.  Nevertheless, 'lit' prices then stabilized, consolidated, and resumed an upward trajectory. 💲 **G M E**  thereby recovered, contrary to the designed-intent of hedge funds' short-selling maneuver, thereby placing even more short-liability risk onto hedge funds tomorrow.
2. On the technicals, the true economic market price is clearly being sought somewhere above $510.00 per share, and to note - the previous high was $508.04 per share on 28JAN2021, moments before brokerages' removal of the 'buy' button.  Today's chart does reveal a favorable ascending wedge chart pattern, as well as a sustained and elevated price departure above the 50 Period Simple Moving Average (30 minute price box-plot durations).  The short-sale interest only grew - now to 22.6 Million shares for short-borrow, now at January 2021 peak levels.  Utilization for shorting is still 100%, and the interest rate to short-borrow with some brokers has ballooned to 85%.  There are three additional investing days in this week.
3. This evidences an outsized risk to any institutional-class client who has investments managed by a hedge fund who may be over-shorting this stock, as hedge funds are now 'in duress' with likely only several business days remaining until this type of price action reaches 'lit' exchanges.  Continued price action now paints a bona fide Bankruptcy risk (upon margin liquidation forced-buy-ins) to these shorting-hedge-funds, while the FBI, DOJ, and SEC continue to hawk their every move for evidence of naked shorting.  Lending counterfeit shares, for selling a company's stock short, is a Class C Felony - it is punishable via 20 Years Prison Sentencing.  Fundamentals for 💲 **G M E** reveal that insiders are continuing to buy raw shares of their company in droves, daily.  Officers of victimized-companies do retain the right to file a multi-company civil suit against wrongdoers in U.S. markets, and in conjunction with criminal charges.  Any and all awards earned via litigation have positive, material effects on company financials and shareholder net asset value.

# TLDR

💲 **G M E**  is 'freely seeking' its true, economic, market price.  On 28JAN2021, the price was $508.04 moments before removal of the buy button.  Today, $510.00 call options were triggered as being 'in the money.'  Charts displayed transacted prices up to $370.00 per share, and logs displayed 300 shares transacted of $275.00 per share.  Further, ask prices, during a temporary halt, indicated 💲 **G M E**  was worth $448,950.00 per share on the ask.  Bloomberg terminal data too evidences these prices.  On the 'lit' NYSE, the price after the open rose to about $200 per share.  Then, as purposefully-orchestrated \[via superhigh-frequency block short-sale orders at 9:35 a.m. EST\], the price was short-laddered down for a few minutes. 💲 **G M E**  investors faced a few-minute halt at 9:37 a.m. EST that \[as evidence suggests\] was engineered by Hedge Fund(s) in order to stay ahead of the trade, perhaps profit, while halting investment opportunities.  Yet, on natural demand for the stock, the market price recovered within the hour, retesting previous highs on the day.  Adding to Hedge Funds' risks of liquidation of their clients' assets, short-borrows have now further increased.  This was even more so accelerated, provided today's 'absorption' of three rounds of short-selling in the same business day (and on a relatively high 17M volume).  Interest rates to borrow are now up to 85%, Short Interest is 25% of the float, there have been 35 days of 100% Utilization, and January 2021 levels of shares on loan (22.6 Million) are now present.  💲 **G M E**  investors referred to their observation of this type of investing day as '*routine.'*  Owners of company shares, who invested through January 2021, experienced multiple limit-up halts *per day,* and at least one 'neutral' day was anticipated.  There are three additional investing days in this week.

Turns out I hit the lottery as farmers across the nation massacred their chicken stocks cuz of bird flu. I got in at about 3750 a contract and cashed out at 4400. 

I apparently did not get all of my Contracts out and now I have people contacting me saying I need to take physical delivery of 10 contracts. A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs!!

I live in an apartment, I cannot take delivery of 50 tons of eggs!! What do I do???? I made a killing so I can hire whoever I need to to make this go away but can someone help me? I do not want 50 tons of eggs coming to my door.

Would it be illegal for me to list delivery address as the nearest federal reserve building???

For reference/perspective: there are between approx 1174 and 2381 DOZEN eggs in a single ton. This puts me at approx 720,000 - 1.2 million eggs. I am really
Stressing out over the logistics of how the fuck I’d ship out this amount of eggs to shelters. It would have to be SO many shelters.

CNBC reports that President Biden is expected to announce a 20% minimum tax for billionaires.,,"President Joe Biden is expected to propose a new minimum tax primarily aimed at billionaires when he unveils his 2023 budget, according to a document obtained by CNBC.

Dubbed the ""Billionaire's Minimum Income Tax,"" it would tax U.S. households worth more than $100 million at a rate of at least 20 percent. More than half of the revenue may come from businesses worth more than $1 billion.

""This minimum tax will ensure that the wealthiest Americans no longer pay less than teachers and firefighters,"" the document said.

We all know that more than 80% of the wealth in this country is concentrated in the hands of 20% of the people. In the stock market, a large number of billionaires have gathered.

We have a visual rebound that is pure green over 5 days, with statistical outliers on the high end- showing that any gain in price has not yet taken hold.  Ortex data shows SI% maxed out for a historic 30 days in a row, a 138% increase in reported-only short-interest over a period of 4 months.  Options activity is on the rise again, with calls jumping ahead of puts in a 1.84:1 ratio.  Implied Volatility supports are rising with a shown historical discount in IV based on historical peaks (currently 0.95 versus 2.1) meaning call options are very discounted here but demand is beginning for them.  And finally, the 15 month price is $225.00 per share, which shows the stock is now at a 58.2% discount to the split-range.

""On March 31, 2022, GameStop Corp. (the “Company” or “GameStop”) announced its plan to request stockholder approval at the upcoming 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) for an increase in the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 300,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 through an amendment to the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) in order to implement a stock split of the Company’s Class A common stock in the form of a stock dividend and provide flexibility for future corporate needs. GameStop also intends to request stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting for a new incentive plan (the “2022 Equity Plan”) to support future
compensatory equity issuances. If the 2022 Equity Plan is approved by stockholders, it will replace the current GameStop Corp. 2019 Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and 8,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, plus any shares subject to the 2019 Plan that expire, are forfeited, cancelled, terminated or settled in cash after the 2022 Plan is effective, will be available for issuance under the 2022 Plan. GameStop’s Board of Directors has approved both stockholder proposals, but the stock dividend will be contingent on final Board approval.""

Very interesting and exciting news given how heavily shorted GME is. Based on the filing, GME has an authorization of 300 mil shares which they intend to increase to 1 bil shares, meaning the split could be anywhere from 1:4 to 1:13. There is speculation that because this is a stock dividend, it may relate somehow to the NFT marketplace GME is introducing later this quarter. Looking forward to what happens.

129,GME - Stock Dividend,DD | GME,"TL;DR short sellers and naked shorts still owe dividends. For short sellers they pay the lender. For naked shorts, they pay the dividend to the buyer. It’s doesn’t make sense to hold the short position if the split is 7:1 or higher. So they’ll have to cover and it could cause a squeeze that could cause a gamma squeeze.

Stock dividend isn’t a normal stock split. It has the same effect of a stock split but the mechanism is different.

Stock split: if there is 100 shares worth $10 each, a stock split, say 2:1 will make 200 shares each worth $5. In this case Hedgies etc don’t have to do anything. Life stays the same. Market cap is still $1000.

Stock Dividend: if there is 100 shares worth $10 and they want to do the same as 2:1 split effectively, the company doesn’t just proclaim a split, instead they give every stock holder a share. Effectively doubling the float as the same as the stock split. Market cap MAY stay high, increase or decrease https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091015/how-dividends-affect-stock-prices.asp

The reason why this is a nuclear option on short sellers is that they have to buy an additional share to distribute to share holders they short sold shares to.

Why, that’s the brilliance behind a stock or cash dividend.  

If I buy a share and lend it out, and the person who borrowed it sold it, I’m still entitled to the dividend. The company will pay me the dividend. But the person who short sold my share either has to rebuy that share (before the ex dividend date) or pay a dividend to the person who bought the shorted stock. And this holds for phantom shares or naked shorts.

There’s 15M shorts (not including naked or phantom shares) Plus there’s the options chain, which is 10M shares at $200, 15M at $250, 20M at $300 (note my data only looks up to a year so it could be way more!!) So as shorts cover they’ll run into a gamma squeeze.

The free float is 63M.
Insiders own 11M or 17%
Institutions own  16M or 26%
The near other half owned by individuals.

This is why a stock split it a nuclear option.

It forces short sellers to buy back shares before the ex dividend date probably sometime in June.

If they don’t they’re are on the hook for additional shares ie if the split is 2:1, they’ll have to buy 15M shares, if 3:1 30M shares, and if 7:1 they’ll buy 90M shares.

So I bet the split will be higher than the outstanding shares available of 75M. 6:1 will require 5 x 15M shares bought which is 75M. So 7:1 will cause a case where the shares that need to be bought will be higher than the float.

I’m not going to time when things will explode, short sellers are playing a dangerous game. Friday morning they dumped 1M shares at open:

https://i.imgur.com/gLZy29J.png (at the time of the dump, short sales jump 1M)

Also the stock dividend is perfect vehicle to make the stock grow massively. Just look at Tesla:

https://imgur.com/a/lF6WVPr

So I’m just loading up now, don’t care about the price now for me because I know it’ll at least double. If 7:1, it’ll be historical.

[The Macro Market is coming off a short-term \(and historic last week\) fibonacci retracement in the upwards direction, on a clear overall macro downtrend - This is also known as a 'bear market rally' - We can see that it was perfectly rejected off of the 50 Day SMA - Signifying that risk-on assets could unfortunately eventually become entrained in an overall bear market downtrend -  G M E  stock has a 'negative beta', meaning it has historically been inverse with the market - so this week and next week we get to observe if that negative beta 'holds up' as it did during the market phenomenon of January 2021, when G M E  'broke' the market](https://preview.redd.it/y8hsox4c65p81.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=371346861ca63588c7d8125b4b42d81dfb17dc2a)

# Rapidly Ballooning Short-Borrow Fees

[Ortex's tweet](https://twitter.com/ORTEX/status/1506331956379750402?cxt=HHwWhMCs3d67yOcpAAAA) shows that short-sale interest did not decrease in yesterday's 50% price increase.  Instead, it went up to 24% of the free float.  Some would ask how the short increase from 21% to 24% in one business day is possible on an already-capped-out-for-31-days 100% utilization?  I digress - and we already know the answer as to why: they somehow obtained more shares to short with, as unreported, and clearly have not even begun to buy to cover their 'current plus new' short-sales yet.  Either way, these shorting-hedge-funds, nevertheless, are now facing elevated capital requirements.  We know that Ortex shows that max cost to borrow just jumped to over 45%, but let's take a look at Interactive Brokers borrow fee:

&#x200B;

[IBKR's short-borrow rate has jumped above 12,000&#37; \(after hours\).  This is statistically significant, as you can visually see the range breakout in the chart.  Pre-market and nominal open borrow rate may indeed be sustained above 100&#37;, which implies an immediate, newfound demand for collateral for those with outsized short-borrows](https://preview.redd.it/0azs5d2bu2p81.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c75056fd43e3b460fcd69bac80a9a777bf5ca1c)

# Half of  G M E  Shares are now 'locked' and not transactable

Contrary to what was implied about me [by mainstream media yesterday](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-shares-soar-30-and-take-other-meme-stocks-on-a-ride-after-reddit-poster-touts-shares-at-a-58-2-discount-11647988145), my fundamental technical analysis was not the primary catalyst of the immediate supply-and-demand-based 50% rise in the share price.  I don't suspect that a billionaire, or anyone really, analyzed [my TA yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tjw86u/g_m_e_where_we_stand_with_the_technicals/) and decided, ""Oh, Thump4's TA shows that the stock is heavily discounted, so I must buy it.""

The real catalyst seems to have been from raw demand, and most notably by G M E's chairman, who independently bought 100,000 more G M E shares in the morning, making his total ownership of the company 11.9%.  Although we have no data on what insiders are buying until SEC 13F forms are filed, insiders may indeed be continuing to purchase more raw shares since they are now able to 2 days after earnings.  Yet, this brings up an interesting technical topic: insider ownership shares are 'locked,' meaning these shares are *not* freely traded on the market.  Therefore, when we combine G M E's Directly Registered computershare total (10 Million shares registered with the transfer agent - 8.9M as noted from the [F-17 Page (page 10 on the pdf of last week's annual report)](https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/71e30d98-2102-4bdd-b0b8-eb151e09f803) and 1M+ estimates thereafter) with 23 Million shares institutionally owned ([as shown from fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)) and thereby restricted, then we have a *past-looking sum* of 33 Million.  We can safely assume that 3 Million more shares will be either bought by insiders and/or directly registered with computershare this week (provided the newfound demand for the stock), so we are at 36 Million shares 'locked'.  Since the shares outstanding total is 76.34 Million, then that means that ***47.2% of the tradable shares outstanding are currently 'locked' and not able to be transacted on any market exchange, regardless of whether that market exchange is 'dark' or 'lit'****.*  This inherently implies that any movement in G M E 's  market price is about twice as sensitive to normal economic demand-vs-supply forces than a typical stock, because the float is literally cut in half.

This leads to a G M E stock price that is now hypersensitive to any demand for the stock, or net volume.  That was shown above, and a two-fold increase in nominal pressure on short-sellers who must fold their poker cards and buy-to-cover their egregious ([and some would say illegal](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-prosecutors-explore-racketeering-charges-short-seller-probe-sources-2022-02-18/)) short-borrow liability position.  Them not doing so would technically lead to a [London-Metal-Exchange-like](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-chinese-nickel-market-mystery-london-metal-exchange-tsinghsan-11647982954) scenario, where in this case the entire global stock market would have to be halted for days for the NSCC to theoretically but illegally allow Citadel Securities, Point72, and other hedge funds to somehow maintain their shorts, similarly to the Chinese nickel short-selling 'tycoon.'  This scenario would permanently destroy faith in American markets for decades.  Them buying to cover now, while the price is still so discounted is safer for them, more responsible for the safety of American markets, and would allow for them to possibly survive this and be able to happily talk about how they got beat (kinda like the Citron Research guy who loved to claim afterward that he was so handsomely defeated by a bunch of reddit 'kids' in this generationally-dynamic market).

# Astronautical Fundamentals - the new digital-asset Marketplace

&#x200B;

[G M E 's non-fungible-asset marketplace is now out in 'beta'.  This being released in the evening, could serve as a new catalyst of buying demand for G M E stock, in that it will lead to a new revenue stream on sales of virtual art and gaming skins, worldwide](https://preview.redd.it/8ypcg42693p81.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a05ad79bfa9e563e115ce9bb63d0bfb5c041050)

# TLDR:

Half of  G M E 's shares are locked and not able to be further transacted.  This has caused an economic shortage of available supply of the stock - and this available supply clearly is rapidly diminishing.  Ortex max cost to borrow just ballooned above 45%, and IBKR's borrow fee rate just ballooned above 12,000%, marking a serious collateral demand and high probability of margin calls of short-sale positions: those short-sellers who now stand to face unlimited economic loss based on the elevated risk they fairly took by shorting this stock.  On Company fundamentals, the[ beta N..F..T.. marketplace website is out](https://beta.nft.gamestop.com/), implying the additional revenue stream from virtual art and gaming skin collectibles [is now live and powered on the backend by loop-ring L2](https://medium.loopring.io/gamestop-nft-marketplace-powered-by-loopring-l2-6cdb9289d937).  Technicals reveal that G M E 's Net Volume, from yesterday's 50% increase in share price, was paltry.  Volume is about 85 Million away from even being classified as a historically-noteworthy day for G M E.

Edit: I am not considering fiddling with my DRS'd shares, nor am I closing [any of my call options positions](https://imgur.com/a/e5upBh9) at any point, even though I am up about 1000% yesterday.  I am upset that my transfer of my tax return into this account did not lead to a successful execution of my order for new call options.  But, I am confident that my new market order for them - yes, I know - for today will be executing at these prices that are clearly so discounted to the real net asset value.  When G M E 's return on their investment is realized, the stock could be worth $1,000.00's of dollars per share, but as a newer, sleeker, Web 3.0, block-chain-backed, highly-sophisticated Amazon-killer.

Edit2 10:19am EST: Macro markets are down, and investors should watch G M E 's notable negative beta to see if that negative beta will 'hold up', or if the stock could become 'entrained' in the macro bear market as noted with the falling dow jones and nasdaq today.  It'll be interesting to observe.  (In January 2021, GameStop's rise did technically 'take down' the market on the beginning of hedge-funds' closing of other long positions that served as liquidity to support their egregious short-borrows - all until the removal of the buy button for  G M E  of course - in violation of securities laws \[FINRA\])",tkp1x9,4747,251,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tkp1x9/g_m_e_giveth_us_more_technicals_they_said/

The slide started last year as a damning series of leaks put massive political pressure on the company and kicked into overdrive as Meta started to feel the multibillion-dollar sting of privacy changes from Apple and Google that are pummelling its advertising business. “People are definitely paying attention and are concerned about the stock price,” Michael Solomon, who manages software engineers through his talent firm 10x Management, told The Post. “I think a lot of people have questions about if Meta is going to get out of this – if this could be the beginning of the end for them.” When software engineers join companies like Meta, Google or Amazon, their compensation typically consists of a roughly 50/50 mix of cash and stock options, with entry-level employees getting more cash and more experienced workers getting more stock, according to data from tech salary tracker levels.fyi. At Meta, new hires are typically given a set number of restricted stock units based on the company’s average stock price around the time they were hired. That means there can be huge upsides for employees who join before a company’s stock rockets – but it also leaves them vulnerable to downturns.

For example, a Meta employee who was given $US100,000 ($A134,000) worth of restricted stock units around the company’s September stock peak would now be left with roughly $US57,000 ($A76,000). It also means that opportunists from other companies – such as Microsoft, which is down 10.3 per cent so far this year – can theoretically “buy the dip” by taking a job at a beaten-down company like Meta, getting more stock options at a lower price. In response to a disgruntled “Metamate’s” post on Blind, one Microsoft employee wrote: “The only people would be doing well are those who are currently transferring companies right now. I’m doing exactly that and headed to Meta.” Laura Martin, a tech and media analyst with Needham & Company, said that while many tech workers may feel loyal to their companies, it makes financial sense for many to switch jobs when the value of their options tanks. “If you’re not going to be making any money in your equity options for three years, it is in your interest to leave,” Ms Martin told The Post. “I agree with the decision to leave your current firm and go to a company and get stock at their current price.”

136,The Fed has more money on its balance sheet (8.9 trillion) then the total value of all 401ks in the United States (7.3 trillion as of 9/21).,sensational / not actionable,"5 trillion of that was added to the Fed’s balance sheet since Feb. 2020: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL

But oh ya, inflation is only happening because the ships and ports and all that jazz. Definitely not also because of the largest instance of debt monetization in the history of mankind.

This behavior jeopardizes the USD’s status as the reserve currency of the world.


Edit: Not saying that expanding the money supply is the only factor driving inflation. Supply chain issues, as we’ve been experiencing, increases inflation. Supply chain issues + expanding the money supply makes inflation even worse; it exacerbates inflation. I’m also not saying it was a bad thing for the Fed to respond as quickly and vigorously as they did. I do, however, think it was a mistake to add 2 trillion more to their balance sheet from August 2020 until now, amid increasing demand pressures and supply shortages. They kept adding to their balance sheet, expanding the money supply, even as the US made it through the eye of its economic storm.

I also chose 401ks as a reference point to compare against. 9 trillion is hard to conceive of. Thought that a unit of comparison would help. Other comparisons. US GDP = approx. 25 trillion. California GDP = approx. 3.5 trillion. Texas GDP = approx. 2 trillion. NY GDP = approx. 2 trillion. Florida GDP = approx. 1.2 trillion. GDP of UK = 3 trillion. GDP of Germany = 4 trillion. GDP of Mexico = 1 trillion. GDP of Canada = 1.6 trillion.

170,Housing isn't coming down. Ever.,Discussion,"So tired of reading the endless copium on housing. I get it. Many of you can't afford homes, that doesn't mean prices are coming down anytime soon.

Despite everything you've heard to the contrary, most houses are owned by people. I know I know: CoRPoraTiOnS ARe buYIng aLL tHe HoMEs!! But it's just not true. For single family rented homes only 300,000 are owned by corporations while 16.2 million are owned by ""mom and pop"" landlords.

To understand how significant this is we need to look at what has recently occurred with mortgage rates. First lets just overview the 30y fixed that's offered to US consumers. This is an incredible deal that doesn't really exist anywhere else in the world. The reason is fairly obvious, it's just a bad deal for the lender. It's a deeply asymmetric trade; if rates go up you get a better deal than before in relative terms, if rates go down you get to refinance at the lower rate.

And that's exactly what happened! Covid struck and all of a sudden people had the chance to refinance bellow 3%, and not just for owner occupied units but rentals too. Every property owner with half a brain took advantage of this.

Fast forward to today and rates are at 4.8%. It might not seem like a big deal, after all rates fluctuate. 1.8% give or take isn't really that big of a deal right? WRONG!

It's a huge deal. We've never pushed rates so low and guaranteed them for so long. Rates need to be viewed on a relative basis. That means paying 4.8% interest is 60% more than 3% with regards to debt maintenance. No one with half a brain is ever going to sell a home they refinanced under 3%. Let that sink in.

Government covid policy has effectively removed a very large percentage of homes from the available market permanently. There will likely never be a time in the future in which selling one of these refinanced single family rentals is a good play. Moreover, the 60 million or so single family owner occupied homes are highly incentivized to never move or if they do turn they're existing home into a rental.

The logical way this plays out does not look good for inventories. People who's financial situation has stayed about the same are extremely unlikely to move. People who's finances have deteriorated are incentivized to hold on for dear life or face significantly worse living conditions, and people who's financial situation has drastically improved are much more likely to rent their old place out and can afford to do so.

Inventories are fukt. And not just right now, but for decades.

All of this has already happened. You can literally watch its effects playing out in the market right now. Looking at market conditions it seems like things are going to get much worse before they get better.

Obviously inflation is the elephant in the room, and the US govt is not well positioned to deal with it. If inflation is permitted to run wild housing will get a huge boost. Most houses are fractionally owned with most money coming from the govt as they are ultimately the primary lender this relationship will mean homeowners are making several times the inflation rate just from holding real property.

Conversely, govt tackles inflation head on (LOL) by raising rates. This will make the those 3% loans too good to give up. Mortgage rates at even 6% will mean you are paying twice as much servicing your debt at those who bought at 3%. 6% is still bellow the current inflation rate, how likely is it for them to ever get inflation bellow 3% without cheating on their CPI.

So, we have an extremely constrained supply that is structurally unable to improve. The only available option is new housing. New housing starts data has been bad for years, and while the numbers have improved lately they 1. Aren't enough,  2. Coming on the back of a major materials/commodities re-pricing and 3. Struggling with labor costs and supply so widespread many laborers are able to choose safer/easier work. Best case (for non-homeowners) is we continue to build at an elevated pace and stop the trend, but this will take years not months.

So before you even get started, no this is nothing like 2008. In 08 people were signing up for horrible variable rate mortgages designed to fuck them, now they've signed up for a bunch of 30y fixed at under 3% designed to stimulate the economy at the expense of the future. So here we are in the future, paying for all those 3% 30y the govt bought up like hotcakes. Even if, as many of you housing bears insist, housing prices come down it will almost certainly be on the back of meaningfully higher lending rates. This will NOT create housing supply since most mortgages are around 3%, unlike 2008 when they were twice that! If interest rates hit 6% and prices drop 40% (they won't) it still wouldn't create the waves of defaults we saw in 2009.

TLDR: Housing operates like all markets, based on supply and demand. There will always be demand but supply will never really come back thanks to ultra loose monetary policy during covid and the govts willingness to buy up all the 30Y mortgage paper. The only way supply constraints can lessen is if asset price inflation is tamed AND rates are close to 3%, so basically never.

Positions: Short 1.2M in mortgage bonds at 2.99% secured by apartments and houses.

Edit: Purpose of this post isn't that housing is cheap and should be bought at these prices, it's that supply has been structurally constrained and this effect is likely permanent. ",tisv9g,3482,2099,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tisv9g/housing_isnt_coming_down_ever/

Well guess what? Time for some karma you rainbow bellied bitch.

I'll never judge a someone for hedging their portfolio, but actively hoping for death, destruction and widespread bankruptcy is another thing entirely.

It's not very nice to want to see the world burn, so that you can make some money.

The next few weeks will tell that just like every other time we thought the end was here - the world is not actually going to cave in on itself.

I will bet you all my money (and I have) that the bottom was Monday.

Reasons why Monday was peak fear:

* The world is beginning to relax a bit as we understand that USA and Russia are not going to nuke each other
* Europe will not lose access to it's energy
* Fertilizers will not be sanctioned, and the crisis will not trigger a global famine
* Despite what the headlines say, Russia was not cut off entirely from SWIFT. Only some banks were.
* Both sides want some form of peace
* Just by looking at the inflationary data from 2021, you can see that we are about to hit an inflection point in inflation growth. The rise in inflation will start slowing until the actual YOY growth rate of inflation starts falling below 8%, then 7%, then 5% etc. Price levels will not fall, but the growth rate will.
* Oil is falling, and is taking pressure off inflation.
* The markets WANT interest rate hikes now. That means the rate hike today is GOOD NEWS.
* On Monday, SPY tested the 200 day and 50 day MA death cross. We bounced.
* Jerome Powell is about to whisper sweet soothing nothings into our ears, like he always does.

So in closing, if you were literally cheering for a global catastrophe in the form of WW3 and hyperinflation so that your stocks would go up:

# You. Are. A. Terrible. Person.

If that's you cheering for pain, fuck you and you deserve your losses.

Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has a net worth of between $41 million and $119 million.

Gensler, who was previously chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., disclosed the figures in a form filed with the Office of Government Ethics, as part of the confirmation process. Income and assets are disclosed in ranges on the form.

His biggest holding, of between $25 million and $50 million, was in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF.

Gensler also said he had $50,001 to $100,000 in capital gains from his holding of Tesla Inc. shares, the only individual stock that’s listed. That asset is now fully divested, according to the filing.

Gensler said he participates in the defined benefit plan at Goldman, where he was a partner earlier in his career. He said the retirement plan is expected to pay out $977 per month starting at age 71.

Dow Jones reported some of the figures from the filing earlier Friday.

Much of Gensler’s money comes from his years at Goldman, which he joined in the late 1970s out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. His mentor was Robert Rubin, who rose to vice chairman of the firm before becoming Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. Gensler had stints trading stocks and bonds, and also worked on the mergers-and-acquisition team. Eventually he became one of the youngest partners in the firm’s history.",ts13t2,2641,274,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ts13t2/gary_gensler_chairman_of_the_securities_and/

&#x200B;

[The 💲 G M E  Gamma 'Snake' - Note: 💲 A M C  too is following this trend](https://preview.redd.it/50nonoc3csq81.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9f1bcfcf47b2a414e3556be582c11c7a712c22d)

&#x200B;

***Note Regarding the Stock Split via a Stock Dividend***:  Before short-sellers come to a position where they have to provide the dividend that they owe on their borrowed shares (via buyback), there would likely be a *share recall* to account for actual share ownership (DRS, etc).  This implies that short-sellers would be *incentivized* to buy-in to cover and return shares prior to the record date of the stock dividend.  Shorting-Hedge-Funds who are considering waiting until after the record date would have to pay back the split-factor on what they owe (in this case, it could a requirement for them to pay back 7x more shares).  If there are 72 Million more shares lent than returned (as of today via Ortex historical data), then they would have to account for 504 Million post-split shares.  Additionally, with any run-up in share price due to the cheaper cost for investors to buy new shares off the open market, short-sellers would have to pay back higher premiums on the 7x shares that they do owe - leading to acute and outsized **risk** for any client who invests with Hedge Funds(s) who have sold these stocks short - risk caused by an increase in margin/collateral requirements that they, if they wait any longer to cover, would not be able to afford.

&#x200B;

***Note Regarding the Split Vote at the Shareholder Meeting***:  Shareholders are normally financially incentivized to vote 'yes' in favor of splits.  This means they must exercise their right to vote (in person or remotely).  All GameStop shareholders would want to pay attention to GameStop company news of when that shareholder meeting and vote takes place.  If shorting-hedge funds want to vote against the share split, they would have to recall lent shares!  Even though Chairman Ryan Cohen did wait until the DRS numbers and insider shares were high enough to be able to secure the vote, votes would still have to be cast by retail investors in order to earn the split approval by majority vote.

&#x200B;

[Unironically, the stocks' price action in this gamma ramp scenario can be described as that of a Green Tree Python Snake, which waits for the right moment before snapping - readily jumping up at its prey - in most cases by a distance of several body lengths](https://i.redd.it/qcs1oud47tq81.gif)

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: Shown in this technical analysis is the Gamma 'Snake', which shows that the gamma ramps are met with expected weekly consolidation (in part due to SHF attempts to falsely-attenuate the market price).  As we discovered with January 21st-28th, 2021, the effect of that hedge fund strategy was met with an outsized price runup.  In this case, GameStop has announced a shareholder split as a dividend, which will continue to add demand for the stock, as shareholders race to collect the increased shares from the split, via a dividend.  This only serves to exacerbate the right-side of the Gamma 'Snake,' in which, similar to end-of-month January 2021, the 💲 G M E  and 💲 A M C  stock prices both become power curves with exponential growth, since they have become hyperconnected through all of the baskets of 'meme-stock' ETFs.

*Although tomorrow is April 'Fools' Day, GameStop and AMC Theatres shareholders are clearly not the 'fools' with their investments.  As today is March 31st, 2022 -this is not a joke-.  GameStop's stock split via dividend, and AMC's expansion, indicate 'a massive position of strength' for the companies.   gg*

**TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices. DRS is the absolute kill switch to this game of psychological warfare because it takes away their most valuable asset in this war - $GME shares.**

This post is going to be a combination of different ideas with an attempt at tying them all together to understand what is going on with $GME, and the markets in general. It involves abstract topics, but I believe this is what we are seeing with $GME, and the market in general - at least until a force majeure occurs and we blast off to uranus and beyond.

Let's assume 100% of $GME stock trading is routed through dark pools. We know this isn't necessarily the case, because obviously some buys hit the lit market, but the point in assuming 100% of the trading is routed through dark pools is that regardless of how much is forced to hit the lit market, a greater amount gets routed through dark pools to counteract the damage. I'll come back to this later.

Richard Wyckoff was an early 20th century pioneer in technical analysis. His position allowed him to witness firsthand the fleecing of retail investors, which brought him to his theories of accumulation/distribution. He described the phenomenon as follows:

***""…all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man’s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it; and to your great profit if you do understand it.""***

Aside from crime (naked shorting, spoofing, etc), how does one LEGALLY take money from retail in the stock market? By getting retail to buy high and sell low, so you can do the exact opposite - what Wyckoff outlined in his accumulation/distribution schematics.

**Accumulation** = pick up assets on the cheap. Following accumulation, as pictured below, is a price mark-up phase. The price is allowed to run to where shares accumulated are profitable.

**Distribution** = dump assets to unsuspecting bag holders. Following distribution is a price markdown phase, where the people controlling the market behind the scenes take profits and hope to scare retail into selling their shares at a loss.

&#x200B;

Based off the image above, we should be in an accumulation phase - which means fairly shortly we should see a mark up phase where the price of $GME is allowed to run. How does this benefit the ""composite man"" behind the scenes? Well, if it WERE to benefit the composite man, we would expect to see him add more shares during accumulation.

Well slap my butt and call me Sally. So we know for certain BlackRock/Vanguard added to their positions in what is assumed to be a time period we should see them add, so they can buy low and theoretically sell high. But how does this pertain to $GME, and why did we assume that 100% of the buying in $GME gets routed to dark pools?

Manipulated movement designed to prey on retails emotions.

This picture describes the Wyckoff accumulation/distribution schematics in EMOTIONS rather than fundamentals - because regardless of what happens behind the scenes, most retail is impulsive and buys off emotions. Do you feel the electricity from UUSB right now? Can you feel the positive emotion in the air surrounding $GME? **THAT'S THE POINT. FOMO BABY! IT'S MARK-UP TIME!**

The far left of this picture describes the mark-up period which I believe we are about to hit (I can't give a time frame, just soonish), and the far right of the picture is where I believe we are now - the disbelief rally. Keep in mind Vanguard and BlackRock already increased their position. Ask yourself why? Are they the composite man? Highly likely they are, as well as other big player institutions that have enough money to manipulate the markets.

I captioned this the mark up table, because a lot of the DD prior using this table has tried tying it to T+2, FTDs, etc.  It's very possible that is the case, but we also have to assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated. If we assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated, this table describes the MARK UP PERIOD outlined in Wyckoff's methods. I don't care WHY or HOW the price is being marked up - just that it is, and it is at roughly the same intervals (every 4 months). Remember - the price is fake until it's not.

It's highly likely that we operate in a completely parasitic system designed to prey on retails emotions by getting them to buy stocks high and sell stocks low. The people with the money (I'm looking at you, Prime Brokers and Hedge funds), are able to manipulate price movement by routing the majority of orders through their dark pools, keeping complete control over pricing of assets so they can enact these mark-up/mark down periods. After all, this is a LEGAL way big players can steal money from retail in the stock market. By buying low and selling high.

How do we win, if an unknown entity with more money, power than we can ever dream of controls every movement of the stock market? **We BUY, HODL, DRS.** We buy the dip. We buy the rip. We fvcking hold, no matter how gut wrenching the movements are. We do not give into the psychology of the market cycle. We force the composite man to resort to shorting and illegal activities to continue the market cycle, all while the noose continues to tighten around his neck through decreased liquidity and increased cost of doing business. **Most importantly, we** **DRS**. The composite man has a ridiculous amount of money and power at its disposal, but most importantly - **he (through Cede and Co.), has our shares.** One real share to the composite man allows him to create theoretically an infinite amount of synthetic shares to force retail through the market cycles again and again and again - so long as he has liquidity, which he can create in a million different ways.

**TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices. DRS is the absolute kill switch to this game of psychological warfare because it takes away their most valuable asset in this war - $GME shares.**",tumdex,2353,493,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tumdex/deep_dive_into_the_market_cycle_and_how_it/

251,Looking at gamma levels for the upcoming expirations for $GME,Technical Analysis," Hi guys, I wanted to take a look at the upcoming options chain for $GME before Monday and see how it would affect next week and what we need to look out for and the levels we need to break to continue this massive rally. I'll also be looking at historical data that also point to another bullish week coming up.

All data found is scraped from various sources and are subject to change based on options buying and selling

What is Gamma and how does it affect the price?

Gamma is the rate of change in delta, Delta is the amount of underlying MMs need to hedge their options positions (assuming that MMs are hedging correctly). So a Gamma ramp would cause a massive increase in delta and MMs would then need to buy a massive amount of underlying stock the stay correctly hedged.

[Gamma levels for the 4\/1 and 4\/8 expiry](https://preview.redd.it/mu9wgy6f1tp81.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccf43dcde31fd11e8c7d3d52e04bd74c1c645d5c)

As you can see we have huge notional gamma at the 150, 160, and 200 levels. As demonstrated last week 160 was a pretty big resistance level for us, usually retail would sell their call options as they edge near the money however with such a big push for option exercising I could see that we push straight through these resistances, especially for T+1 options settlement on Tuesday. Looking at the rest of the chain after we push through 160 there are no real resistances until we hit the 200 level so If we break 160 I expect 200 is very likely after.

(As more options are bought and sold gamma levels can change and we could see a change in the chain)

&#x200B;

[Open interest for 4\/1 and 4\/8](https://preview.redd.it/rlpt3cti1tp81.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=83878bc444587d03ec63b1d9b52a3d1111835f16)

Huge open interest on the 200 and 265 strikes and as the price nears these strikes the gamma would increase exponentially, especially for very OTM strikes causing a huge upswing in positive delta and MM buying. It would also cause the negative delta on the puts to be unwound and cause buying pressure as the MMs unhedge those puts that are now OTM.

&#x200B;

As you can see Week 13 based on historical data is a bullish week for us, January and February are skewed due to the sneeze but having a historically good week will help for a push up this week. 

[Daily average returns &#37; based on historical data for $GME](https://preview.redd.it/ohz0np2m1tp81.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=26324a27bc0ec26b294ac34488dd1e114ecdb856)

We also have historically greater returns at the beginning of the week than later so especially with options settlement we could see a very explosive Tuesday and Wednesday.

TLDR: We have a lot of positive factors this week that will increase the pressure on the shorts, I would like to see us break above 160 and then likely see a big push to 200. I would expect a big push on Tuesday or Wednesday based on historical data.

253,GME strategy. Exercising calls and strategically buying OTM puts and calls literally can’t go tits up.,Discussion,"I see 3 possible outcomes tomorrow. It’s simple. I’ll explain my theories and tell you how to make money off the possible outcomes. 

As you all know there are a ton of call options that are ITM that weren’t supposed to be ITM this week. I don’t know about you but I don’t see this price action stopping this week so I’m actually going to exercise a few 100 strikes. I doubt I’m the only one because this baby is going to the moon.  

WS is probably going to bring this heat tomorrow more ways than one but here’s how to how you make money and apply buying pressure. 

It’s actually hilarious because I think their only way out is to cheat. 

Most likely scenario: I see an iv crush in the AM with no gap down to deter swing traders from buying in. This slow uptrend isn’t working for them today. Apes must have learned patience last year. There will be a de-hedging scenario in which market makers sell their shares (that they never bought…yet) because people with take profits on calls and not everyone has enough money to exercise them. It’s inevitable. This doesn’t change the fact that more calls will be bought but they will get people to paper hand. 

How do you solve this? Clearly you buy OTM puts at the open to hedge your bullish position. This way market makers lose both ways, and the only other solution for them is to cover short positions, pay up on the puts or calls, or get dirty. Long story short…If they need it down then make them pay you for it. It’s ok if you lose money on puts i literally was up 70% on my long calls today and down 80% on my puts. I made no money but I’m prepared and I didn’t lose money. 

Best case scenario: as soon as think they won. Someone or institution buys a crap ton of shares, creating fomo again, retail starts buying more calls…WS panics and the road to ATH begins after hours.


Worst case scenario: some fed propaganda comes out tanks the whole market and and Gme of course goes down with it on some illegal dark pool derivative Wall Street stuff (I mean, does it really matter right now?) guess what you bought puts and make more money then you would have on calls. 

I’m not talking about 0 day options here, at least 1-2 weeks out. I got 20 130 puts for 4/1 and and 60 250 call strikes for 4/14. 

Also is it just me or is the We3d stock shit come back just on time - same as last year. Do you, but I don’t give a shit. Stay focused. You know what’s happening and you know the truth. 

TLDR: hedge OTM puts. Exercise calls. Hold. This is how normal folk can help. It’s actually more effective than buying shares rn since settlement takes 2 days but of course buy and hold. 

This is not financial head lice 🫠

Edit morning update: As of market open…It appears I should have just bought all calls. I still believe puts close the money still help keep the price up short term.

Edit 2: 11:20am. Scenario 3 literally happened. Shaved off some Gme call profits when I saw the fed was going to speak and figured if I were them it would be a good time to tank the market. That’s another reason I believe the Gme squeeze is the real deal. Bought some SPY 0DTE before 11am in case Gme just kept going up. It was good timing 50x445 spy p 0DTE quick 3x - fuck em. Still not tits up.

The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, claimed Musk violated securities laws by not revealing by March 24 that he had accumulated a stake of at least 5% in Twitter (ticker: TWTR). The lawsuit alleges that by March 14, Musk’s stake in Twitter had reached 5%, which required him to publicly disclose his stake 10 days later by March 24. Musk didn’t file the required disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission until April 4, after he had boosted his position to more than 9%.

Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella filed the lawsuit against Musk. He is seeking to have the lawsuit certified as a class action for shareholders who sold Twitter stock between March 24 and April 1.""

Instead of ripping off the bandage and letting the market decide, Putin and his infinite wisdom has artificially propped up the major stocks using funds from the Central Bank so that it appears that the market is rising, but only upon first glance.  They banned short selling and foreign stock sales and only allowed trading of a very small amount of stocks in a very small window of time.

Recently, I've been arguing with internet finance professionals over the overused and misunderstood argument of ""POPCORN is a cheaper stock to own than GME"" or ""Why would I buy 1 GME share when I can have 10 POPCORN shares?"" or my personal favorite ""if both stocks go to $10,000 at one point in the squeeze, than which one makes more sense to buy now you fucking idiot?!?!"".

All of which are valid arguments if you have no understanding of equity or market capitalization. But since our world has logic and concepts, they are unfortunately wrong... or fortunately wrong depending on how you want to look at it.

Here are some examples of exchanges I have had recently that pissed me off enough to spend almost two hours sifting through data and subsequently writing up a ""DD"" about it. And really, I'm only writing this because I'm tired of having to explain it, so from now on, I can just link this to them instead.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/901kgxd2zcr81.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=271070d092e60358faab8a9e33e55bd753200886

There are others, but you get my point.

&#x200B;

# Price, Market Capitalization & Equity.

Here is the most basic example of what I'm trying to prove:

If company A has 100 shares for $1 and company B has 50 shares for $2, both of their market caps equal $100. If you buy $10 worth of stock in both, you get 10 shares of company A and 5 shares of company B. Sure you have more shares of company A, but your equity ownership in both companies is the same. You own 10% of the company. That’s equity. Price is arbitrary.

If this is some psyop narrative being pushed by hedgies - congratz. It is working and you got bonus points for wasting my time. But, in the more probable situation... these people are just oblivious and fell for the psychological barrier to entry coupled with the return solely based on future price.

This ""trick"" is used by many. Recently and more notably, the Qrypto Alt Coin market took this concept by the balls and applied it harder than the investors that bought into these coins applied to Wendy's a few months after making their initial purchase.

The psychological barrier to entry is the perceived value an investor is getting for his or her money based on the actual dollar price per unit of the investment that they are buying and nothing else. They see this asset as a ""deal"" because of its low price point and their compulsion to buy is compounded by their unreasonable perception of the ceiling for potential future prices might be. Those Alt Coins with a $0.0000001 price per coin are using this concept to a ridiculous degree, which is why a lot of them got any traction in the first place. Moving on.

&#x200B;

# The Proof

I took the closing price of both stocks over the past two years (starting from 3/13/2020) and multiplied the outstanding shares (adjusting for any changes in OS) to get to the market capitalization for both stocks each and every day. Finally, I made a line graph chart to visualize the data because I know I'm writing to an audience that mostly indulges in picture books and I need to keep your attention.

The X-axis provides dates starting from 3/13/2020 to 4/1/2022 and the Y-axis provides you with the market capitalization. The red line represents POPCORN and the black line represents GME. I've chosen the colors for the two stocks with coincidence and appropriately… ;). Yes, before the sneeze in January 2021, GME was the more expensive stock. But after the sneeze and the run-ups in June, this is no longer the case. In fact, for the better of half a year, POPCORN was overwhelmingly more expensive to buy than GME. It was only until 1/27/2022 that their market caps were essentially equal to one another and their equity values per dollar were approximately 1 to 1. From 6/2/2021 (the date that POPCORN reached its peak) to 1/27/2022, popcorn was on average 26% more expensive on any given day than GME and maxed out at 43% more expensive on 9/10/2021 when the market capitalization of GME was $14.5B and POPCORN was $25.7B.

&#x200B;

# Let's do a hypothetical.

If you would have bought $1,000 worth of both stocks every day since 4/1/2021, you would have made $254,000 worth of buys in each stock.

(254 trading days since 4/1/2022 multiplied by $1,000)

I'm using 4/1/2021 as the date since it is the aftermath of the GME sneeze and before the POPCORN run-up to its peak on 6/2/2021. Plus it is exactly one year, so... I think it is a fair place to start.

As of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,598 shares of GME and 11,156 shares of popcorn valued at $263,595 and $259,924, respectively. It gets worse for popcorn.

Now, let's do another hypothetical and say you missed the run-up in January for GME and the run-up in popcorn in June. You saw the crazy amounts of money people were making and wanted a piece of the action, so you FOMO in both stocks, not knowing any better. You do the same exercise as I mentioned previously by buying $1,000 worth of both each day starting on 8/2/2021. This time, there were 170 trading days. So you purchased $170,000 in both stocks.

As of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,144 shares of GME and 6,458 shares of popcorn valued at $188,767 and $150,480, respectively.

In this scenario, not only are your GME shares worth more, you are actually losing almost $20,000 on POPCORN. This only gets worse as you move closer to 1/27/2022 when the stock's market capitalizations finally converge.

In the past 30 trading days, on average GME has only been 3% more expensive than POPCORN. So now would be a better time than ever to convert equity to GME.

But price points shouldn't be the only thing you consider. If you are a POPCORN holder and you don't realize that GME has set itself up with multiple catalysts in the coming months, you need to open your eyes. This may be the last time to get into GME before it explodes my tits. But this really wasn't the purpose of my post. I simply wanted to prove that POPCORN is not cheaper than GME with irrefutable evidence. But it's your money. Do what you want. NFA.

The great news is he can buy approximately 5.9 million more shares. If each 100K shares he purchases moves the price by $30 (like today), we'll be at  $1,900/share when all is said and done. But I have a feeling we could be even higher since there will be some ""short"" covering, probably.

[The Market backdrop is rife with fear: inflation and\/or stagflation, continued fed interest rate hikes, a historic yield-curve inversion, geopolitical conflict, unreasonably expensive oil prices, destruction of Ukraine, economic destruction of Russia \(#10 economy\), taxing of China \(#2 economy\), Evergrande, Margin Unwinding, Depletion of Stimulus \(globally\), an evolving Pandemic, and runaway national debts](https://preview.redd.it/a9iy9awtojq81.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b32fd83df053805f61ad32717167cf87167dd45)

&#x200B;

[Bank of America](https://www.thetimesoftruth.com/bear-market-rally-warning-this-inventory-surge-is-a-bear-market-lure-warns-bofa/) is now warning that the 'Bear Market rally', otherwise known as a short-term Fibonacci retracement in the upwards direction of a macro downtrend, is done.  Therefore, they're calling for a continued de-risking of equities and risk-on assets.  Based on my independent analysis above, I am in agreeance with BofA.

Too, the London Metal Exchange (LME), as backed by J.P. Morgan, bailed out their short-seller(s) at the expense of everyone else.  In a way that you would only wish that I was making up, the LME just 'undid' days of trades, made by smart investors who beat the 'short-selling tycoons' of the nickel markets.  This type of care-free destruction of public trust in markets could very well spread to the U.S., where investors are already skeptical about the Fed's correlations with short-selling bad actors in the market who are actively being investigated by the DOJ.  As we can see daily, the Fed's reverse repo 'overnight' program has been exploited on the order of $2 Trillion - this is in combination with a $10 Trillion Fed balance sheet, new requests for $6 Trillion budgets, and the [$4.5 Trillion Fed private 2019 bailout of Wall Street banks behind the backs of American taxpayers](https://tokenist.com/fed-finally-identifies-banks-received-4-5t-q4-2019-repo-program/).

Further, it was shown that [Barclays was just fined](https://www.ft.com/content/386df3ee-4b9d-45c5-9ae1-d5dffb2a822e) for half a Billion USD for over-shorting VXX which is an ETN that is associated with volatility and S&P 500 futures.  They literally short-sold 15 Billion USD of this volatility ETN BEYOND their $20 Billion limit as required by the U.S. - thereby creating false 'stability' pressures (yes: using wide-scale short-selling phenomena to subdue an important volatility ETN that is connected to the entire market system via S&P 500 contracts, options and futures) thereby inducing *fake* macro market stability during a time of geopolitical conflict, in order to put on a front of western market stability... in a way that simply did not make sense to economists.  Now, they have several weeks to months to *buy back all of these shares (thereby going long in volatility ETNs with tens of billions of dollars)*, or face blacklisting from U.S. regulators.  Similar in a few ways to the 'short-vol' XIV scandal in 2018, but in this case 'long vol,' this will surely add to the volatility in markets going forward.  That was owned by Credit Suisse.  That blew up.  That no longer exists.  Will the VXX ETN 'survive' in this process?  You can count on it that there is a line or two [in the 285 page prospectus](https://ipathetn.barclays/ipath/details/341408/download-content/7726665) that will probably lead to a 'no' answer.  Nevertheless, every investment associated with that will be Sayanora.  With the \^VIX having fallen in-a-perfectly-straight-line from 39 to 19 line over three weeks \[*and now we know why*\]:  I am now 'bullish', or perhaps even 'apish', on volatility.

***""One small single event can trigger an unstoppable chain of events that gain momentum with increasing force, and nothing is ever the same.""***

https://preview.redd.it/vqhozfyguio81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=d34bf8569d76ca35df8c8193f84ebbb3d1455d01

**What is a stock split and how is it executed?**

A stock split is a simple decision by the company board to increase (or in some cases decrease) the outstanding shares of the company. For example, let’s say you own 10 shares of company X worth $100 each. So in total, you own $1K worth of shares in the company. If the company announces a 2-for-1 stock split, now you will have 20 shares of the company worth $50 each. But the total value of shares you own in the company does not change. You will still own the same $1k (20 x 50) worth of shares that you started with.

If you are wondering why companies engage in stock splits, the following are some of the key reasons.

* **Affordability:** Sometimes the stock becomes too expensive for retail investors to buy into. Consider Amazon - One stock is worth close to $3k now. So the minimum amount you would need to start in Amazon is $3k which might not be affordable to a vast majority of retail investors\[1\]. Also, there is the psychological impact of buying a share worth $3k and a share worth $30.
* **Options:** For the options players, there is a huge difference when a stock is cheap. In options, a single contract is worth 100 shares. So for a covered call strategy incorporating Amazon, before stock split, you would need a single stock position worth more than $275K vs only \~$14K exposure after the said 20:1 stock split.
* **Liquidity:** Since more shares are outstanding for the company after the split, it will result in greater liquidity and a lesser bid-ask spread. It also allows the company to buy back their shares at a lower cost since their orders would not move up the share price as much, due to higher liquidity.

Now before we jump into the analysis, you should understand how exactly a stock split is executed. On **announcement day**, investors get to know that a stock split is going to happen soon. The stockholders eligible for the stock split are decided on the record date. This is mainly a formality. The actual split would happen on the **ex-split date (or ex-date)**. After this, the stocks would trade at their new price. For example, in a 20:1 split, the stocks would trade at 1/20th the previous price after the ex-date. From our data, we observed that there was an average delay of 36 days between the announcement day and ex-split date.

**Data**

For this analysis, I have used the data from [Fidelity’s stock split calendar](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/conferenceCalls.jhtml?tab=splits) that tracks the announcements and execution of stock splits, from as far back as 1980! I have considered splits only from 1993 (due to stock price data availability), and I have considered only companies that currently have a market cap of $1Billion or above. I have also ignored reverse stock splits as the data is too small to be statistically significant.

This gives us a total of more than 2,000 stock splits to work with. In case you are interested in the raw data, I have shared both the raw data and analysis through links at the end \[2\].

https://preview.redd.it/x8h8blyguio81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0d041f9f055ee500acd73cf6138a01c7a5ac231

**Returns**

As soon as a stock split is announced, there is bound to be a lot of buying and selling activity. The question is, how much return could you have seen? There are a few scenarios possible here.

Short Term Returns

The short term plays possible around stock splits are:

1. You already own the stock and see its price go up on announcement day.
2. You did not own the stock on the announcement day so you buy the stock just before the actual stock split execution.

https://preview.redd.it/fl7oqcsjuio81.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=16d7ec01076f52f08ede2039e8ea7cdd957977c2

As expected, the announcement of a stock split sends the stock pumping with a 1.48% 2-day return when compared to only 0.09% return generated by SPY during the same time period. You would still have beaten the market if you had bought the stock one day before the actual split execution day and then held it for two days (albeit by much less - 1/7th of the gains you would have made if you had owned it before the announcement).

**Long Term Returns**

Considering that a stock split is supposed to indicate growth prospects, what happens when you hold for a longer time? There are two possibilities:

1. You buy the stock just after the announcement of the split
2. You buy the stock on the split execution date.

https://preview.redd.it/essyyjokuio81.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6ccd70cba51ecb914ee701f172edd3cd571b206

Buying just after the announcement would have paid off handsomely with the returns beating the market easily in the long run. On average you would have had an alpha of 1.5% over the market in just over a month.

But, on the other hand, if you buy it on the day of the split, the returns are not that great. You would have lost money in the first week on average and would have been underperforming SPY even over the period of one month. You would have had to wait about a year for your portfolio to overtake SPY. This is to be expected because by the time of the actual split, the hype has died down a bit and the rallies in price are a bit more uncertain.

**What about H\*DLers?**

This is another interesting case where you would have bought stocks on their announcement date or ex-split date and held on till today, starting from 1993 \[3\]. Though most people wouldn’t trade by this strategy, it’s interesting to see how it would have fared. \[4\]

https://preview.redd.it/5ppjqxnluio81.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bee120527137854a90283c09b21fa48aed3be8f

If you had bought all stocks that underwent a split and held till today, you would have beaten the S&P 500 by close to 200%!

**How certain are our returns?**

Next, we have to look into whether the alpha we are seeing here is due to a few stocks that are skewing the results. Even though I have capped for outliers, I wanted to know what % of stocks undergoing a split beat the market over the different time periods that we just saw.

https://preview.redd.it/3yoxgb6nuio81.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=04b15b141dec86671bd201fda1a175e2067d281d

Well, would you look at that! Except in one case, the odds would be in your favor to beat the market if you had followed this strategy. As expected, for short term the highest chance is if you had owned the stock before the announcement (which is not realistic), but even if you had bought it one day after the announcement, you would have had almost a 60% chance of beating the market by the actual execution day.

https://preview.redd.it/1hrdo5zguio81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=135b16d8f4aa8177feecfe5a184f75b350a1c1d6

**The cheap and the expensive**

The usual rationale behind a stock split is that the stock has become too over-priced, and splitting it makes it cheaper for retail investors to buy into - But the data revealed some contrary insights. Over 90% of the stocks were less than $52 in value at the time of the split, and only 5% were over $230 in value!

So obviously, the question is - **Was there an advantage to buying cheaper stocks or more expensive stocks at the time of a split**, and how did they compare to the total set and the benchmark?

The 10 percentile value for the adjusted close at the time of announcement was $3.50 (203 stocks less than this value), and the 90 percentile value was around $43 (203 stocks more than this value). Here are the average returns for these sets.

https://preview.redd.it/xx0itidouio81.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=b090eaeadb0c5d22b2ddfb6bde45a8c2aea0bd2e

The lower-priced stocks seem to have a massive advantage in almost all respects, sometimes giving a return of more than twice the complete set of splits in the long term! On the other hand, the higher-priced stocks have a poor record - Though they beat the benchmark in the short term\[5\], in the long term, their performance is much lower than the stocks having a lower price.

One of the reasons that the lower-priced stocks have such a high average is because stellar companies like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Nike, etc. were trading for less than 5 dollars per share in the 90s - But this doesn’t invalidate the observation. There were stocks trading for more than 100s of dollars around the same time, and they didn’t do as well as the lower-priced stocks. This insight could mean that ***companies with a lower share price that go for a stock split now have a higher possibility of growth than huge stocks*** like Amazon or Google.

https://preview.redd.it/rjt6ruzguio81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=e92d0f4b561e06c2964393adae1d218c6a0566b3

**Limitations**

The analysis seems to indicate that stock splits are a sure-shot buy. But there are some caveats to keep in mind before trying to replicate this:

1. There are a variety of large, mid, and small-cap stocks that underwent stock splits. Comparing the returns solely to the S&P 500 might not be the most ideal way to calculate Alpha since the S&P 500 comprises of the biggest 500 companies in the U.S. So the alpha we are seeing here might just be compensating for the extra risk we are taking buying into smaller companies.
2. The stock splits selected here are companies that have a market cap of at least $1Billion. While this is reasonable and covers more than 60% of the sample set, there will be survivorship bias due to a lot of companies dying out or performing mediocrely (especially applies to the Buying and holding forever strategy).

https://preview.redd.it/s1b3ad0huio81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a369de6aa0bce5728a373106f6deb3788bfcc61

**Conclusion**

Buying and holding stocks at the time they are undergoing a split might not be an outrageously successful strategy - But it definitely has an edge, both in the short term and especially in the long term. This gives some credence to the statement that a stock split indicates good prospects of growth.

And if you’re wondering whether the right time to buy is during the announcement or the actual split, the data shows that **there is a clear advantage to buying around the time of the announcement**, especially for short-term plays. The probability of success is also 60% and above in many cases, indicating that there is something more to this than mere chance.

And finally, stocks with a smaller price seem to do much better than stocks with higher prices when it comes to stock splits. While this could just be the compensation for the risk you are taking investing in smaller companies, it’s definitely worth looking into!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] Along similar lines, to own a single Class A share of Berkshire Hathaway, you need $489K. There are some theories that certain companies have very high share prices because they don’t want retail investors (who are usually fickle in ownership) to own their stock. This usually leads to lesser volatility for the said stocks. One other point to consider here is that there are more and more brokers who are offering fractional shares these days. So stock splits might not be as relevant as it was before.

\[2\] This should make your life much easier as we had to use web scraping to pull all the data.

\[3\] Walmart split its stock [11 times](https://stock.walmart.com/investors/stock-information/dividend-history/default.aspx) on a 2-for-1 basis between their IPO in October 1970 and March 1999. An investor who bought 100 shares in Walmart’s IPO would have seen that stake grow to 204,800 shares over the next 30 years!

\[4\] In fact, [there was an ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TOFR/)that bought stocks that were going for 2:1 stock splits.

346,"Fed hikes rates, signals aggressive turn against inflation",,"Source: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/all-systems-go-feds-liftoff-us-interest-rates-2022-03-16/

WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and projected its policy rate would hit a range between 1.75% and 2% by year's end in a newly aggressive stance against inflation that will push borrowing costs to restrictive levels in 2023.

In a new policy statement marking the end of its full-on battle against the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. central bank flagged the massive uncertainty the economy faces from the war in Ukraine and the ongoing health crisis, but still said ""ongoing increases"" in the target federal funds rate ""will be appropriate"" to curb the highest inflation in 40 years.

The statement dropped direct reference to the coronavirus pandemic but instead cited the war in Ukraine as creating ""additional upward pressure on inflation"" and weighing on economic activity.

The interest rate path shown in new projections by policymakers is tougher than expected, reflecting Fed concern about inflation that has moved faster and threatened to become more persistent than expected, and put at risk the central bank's hope for an easy shift out of the emergency policies put in place to fight the fallout from the pandemic.

Even with the tougher rate increases now projected, inflation is expected to remain above the Fed’s 2% target, remaining at 4.1% through this year and dropping only to 2.3% through 2024. Economic growth is seen at 2.8% this year, a sharp drop from the 4.0% growth projected in December.

The unemployment rate is seen dropping to 3.5% this year and remaining there next year, but is projected to rise slightly to 3.6% in 2024.

The new statement said the Fed expects to begin reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet ""at a coming meeting,"" a topic likely to be addressed further by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a news conference due to begin at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT).

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard was the only policymaker to dissent in the Fed's decision.",tfo9j4,1531,520,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tfo9j4/fed_hikes_rates_signals_aggressive_turn_against/

We will focus on this AMC gold miner deformed dumpster baby that literally gets sketchier the deeper you really look.

But first, how greasy is this deal? [Greasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7FsAgPuVwU)

Let us dive in:

1st: Let me take this layup real quick, movie theatre executives don't know dick on how to fucking mine for natural precious metals. Coincidentally, this is about as close as a YOLO a corporate executive/board can go.

2nd: HYMC coincidentally drops an ATM stock offering this morning of up to 500 million unloading on apes as the stocks price launches. For those who don't understand, they are essentially able to soak up this 500% share price increase in taking a shitload of cash while massively diluting their shares. Isn't it odd that this was left out of the AMC press release and not spoken about at all on MSM today? Personally, I read an article in Barrons and NYT that completely failed to even mention it once. Side note: in a total dipshit move that makes Cramer look normal aaron [canceled](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1503763167473713155?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) his appearance on CNBC with a dumbass reply, what a fucking dweeb. Everyone knows in the era of Elon Musk, laws and court orders don't matter on Twitter and TV.

3rd: Goldminers largest shareholder is Mudrick Capital \~40% of stock outstanding. For you true autists, this is the same Mudrick Capital who bought 8.1 million shares of AMC stock in a closed offering and then sold the very same day. Wow, ain't that fucking weird. 

4th: The movements of this stock before this announcement are fucking sketch as hell. Take a look at 2.50 strike [call](https://imgur.com/a/62YCIqU) open interest. So you telling me that some entity just decided to yolo massive amounts of money on massive OTM calls days till expiry on some shit profitless mining company right before a fucking movie theatre buys a massive stake? Call me sherlock holmes cause that's suspicious. 

\-Granted, most of the volume for these options came in Friday at prices between .15 and .60 and the options barely got above .30. Nonetheless, sketch as hell. But the general movements of the stock before the announcement is undeniable.

4.5: This one isn't of any substance but I think it's worth something. This fucker took a picture with a sign in the middle of the desert as a showing of quality, no gold production or busty facilities. This is essentially if Elon Musk came out to woo his retarded investors with a new car model and instead of showing an actual car he shows a drawing.

Like fuck me, put me in charge of Wendys and I'll invest in Diane Fosseys Gorilla fund so apes can break free from behind the dumpster and frolic free in the wild while simultaneously solving climate change by making biofuel from their shit.

# TLDR:

*Technicals*: $ G M E is at a 46.1% discount to its 15-month technical fair value. $ T L R Y is at a 74.9% discount. Evidence was presented via Ortex that $ G M E short-borrow utilization is still 100% (34 days now), a cost to borrow as high as 40%, with now an insidious 25% short-interest of the float, and a 188% rise in short interest over four months. These stocks were together placed in 30+ ETFs, which were then the targets of mass-short-sale attacks. These ETFs, such as XRT, have short interest % of the float around 1,250.00%, indicating a risk of termination of these ETFs based on their prospectus, upon any rise in price of the stock(s), thereby indicating that hedge funds have taken irresponsible levels of risk in their selling and lending of shares that they do not own. This places even more pressure on hedge funds to buy these meme stocks in order to cover their now-historic short-borrow liabilities.

*Statistical Correlations of 'Meme-Stocks'*: It was revealed that the MemeStock 'labeling' and/or 'targeting' mechanism ('Meme-Stock' was a purposeful theme applied by hedge funds and the mainstream media in order to classify stocks liked by younger generations of investors) has now led to a high 97% statistical R correlation in all 'Meme-Stock' charts. $ G M E and $ T L R Y share this correlation, as evidenced. Nevertheless, this 'Meme-Stock' phenomenon effectively makes all of them the 'same' stock, with market caps that jointly fluctuate with or without news from either of them. Therefore, as yet another risk to hedge funds who have egregiously sold $ G M E short: increases in the market caps of cannabis 'Meme-Stocks,' such as $ T L R Y, do apply substantial margin capital risks to 'Meme-Stock' short-sellers who remain At Large in our once-free stock market.  The preponderance of the evidence reveals that *their short positions only grew last week*, even though $ G M E rose 100% and $ T L R Y rose 70%.

Prices rose across the UK economy at the fastest rate in 30 years in the year to February, intensifying a cost-of-living crisis in the country.

Year-on-year consumer price index inflation hit 6.2% in February, the Office for National Statistics [said](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/february2022) Wednesday, the highest level since 1992. The reading was up from 5.5% in January, and above economists' expectations of 6%.

""Inflation rose steeply in February as prices increased for a wide range of goods and services, for products as diverse as food to toys and games,"" Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said.

The jump in inflation adds to the chances that the Bank of England will hike interest rates again at its next meeting on May 5. It has already raised them for [three meetings in a row](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/bonds/bank-of-england-interest-rates-uk-economy-inflation-ukraine-conflict-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets), taking the main rate from a record low of 0.1% to 0.75%.

London's [FTSE 100](https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/ftse_100?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) stock index was up 0.52% after the figures were released. The [pound](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/gbp-usd?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) was down 0.23% to $1.323.

The figures make tough reading for Britons, who are now seeing prices rise faster than wages and face a steep rise in living costs in the spring.

Energy bills are set to soar in April after wholesale prices skyrocketed and the government lifted a price cap. Prices at the fuel pump have also risen sharply, and the Ukraine conflict risks sending energy prices even higher.

The government is also increasing taxes in April, as it worries about the state of the public finances following a surge in spending during the coronavirus crisis.

There is little sign that the cost-of-living crisis will abate any time soon. The Bank of England expects inflation to soar above 8%, and even suggested it could hit double digits if global energy prices continue to rise.

UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil measures to ease some of the burden on households when he delivers a spring economic statement later Wednesday. However, he has argued in favor of tax rises in the face of opposition from within his own party.

Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said he expects inflation to rise significantly over the coming months.

""The impact of rising global goods prices continued to feed through,"" he said. ""What happens further out will be heavily influenced by the geopolitical situation and its impact on commodity prices.""

Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expects the Bank of England to be cautious about how far it raises interest rates.

""With the economic recovery likely to slow sharply as households feel the pinch, and domestically-generated inflation still relatively subdued, we expect the Committee to pause raising Bank Rate, once it has increased it to 1% in May,"" he said.

""Further rate hikes would increase the risk of a [recession](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-recession?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) and the chances that CPI inflation ultimately would significantly undershoot the 2% target in the medium term.""",tkr47l,1328,167,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tkr47l/uk_inflation_jumps_to_a_30year_high_of_62/

>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday vowed tough action on inflation, which he said jeopardizes an otherwise strong economic recovery.

>“The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high,” the central bank leader said in prepared remarks for the National Association for Business Economics.

>The speech comes less than a week after the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years in an attempt to battle inflation that is running at its highest level in 40 years.

>Reiterating a position the Federal Open Market Committee made in its post-meeting statement, Powell said interest rate hikes would continue until inflation is under control. He said the increases could be even higher if necessary than the quarter-percentage-point move approved last Wednesday.

>“We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability,” he said. “In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

...

>As he has before, Powell ascribed much of the pressures coming from pandemic-specific factors, in particular escalated demand for goods over services that supply could not meet. He conceded that Fed officials and many economists “widely underestimated” how long those pressured would last.

>While those aggravating factors have persisted, the Fed and Congress provided more than $10 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus. Powell said he continues to believe that inflation will drift back to the Fed’s target, but it’s time for the historically easy policies to end.

>“It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain,” said Powell, whose official title now is chairman pro tempore as he waits Senate confirmation to a second term. “In the meantime, as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.”

>Powell also addressed the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying it is adding to supply chain and inflation pressures. Under normal circumstances, the Fed generally would look through those types of events and not alter policy. However, with the outcome unclear, he said policymakers have to be wary of the situation.

>“In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price shocks,” he said. “However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the Committee to move expeditiously as I have described.”

>Powell had indicated last week that the FOMC also is prepared to begin running off some of the nearly $9 trillion in assets on its balance sheet. He noted that the process cold begin as soon as May, but no firm decision has been made.",tjg116,1315,269,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tjg116/powell_if_we_conclude_that_it_is_appropriate_to/

401,"Stock Traders Brace for a $3.5 Trillion ‘Triple Witching’ Event tomorrow March 18, 2022",," 

In a quarterly event known as triple witching, roughly $3.5 trillion of single-stock and index-level options are set to expire, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. At the same time, more near-the-money options are maturing than at any time since 2019 -- suggesting a bevy of investors will actively trade around those positions.

And once [again](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/triple-witching-to-hit-market-where-traders-pay-up-for-hedges), this triple witching coincides with a rebalancing of benchmark indexes including the S&P 500 -- a combination that tends to spark single-day volumes that rank among the highest of the year. According to an estimate from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the rebalance in the index alone could spur $33 billion of stock trades.

Friday’s session lands just as the S&P 500 regains its [footing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/stocks-aided-by-upbeat-powell-bonds-flash-caution-markets-wrap) with a three-day jump, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s optimism the economy can withstand rate hikes and China’s promise to bolster its financial markets. Yet in the telling of derivatives pros, the rally has been fueled by dealers covering short positions to balance exposures while demand for stock hedges is elevated.

Now as many contracts expire, the key question is whether investors will rebuild their holdings of protective puts amid growth concerns and the war in Ukraine -- or will they chase the market rebound with call contracts. 

“I’ve never seen an environment where you’ve had so many potential overhangs in the market that can not be controlled,” said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. “We’ll see if people can see to redeploy their puts.”",tgpmq2,1289,248,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tgpmq2/stock_traders_brace_for_a_35_trillion_triple/

418,Broker Dealers & Mutual Funds/ETFs Have A LOT of GME Securities Lending Counterparty Exposure - Let's Explore Some Numbers,DD | HSBC,"**\*Obligatory,** none of this information is financial advice and is the result of my studies. All investors must do their own due diligence, come to their own conclusions, and make their own financial decisions.

**TL;DR** Broker Dealers (primarily believed to be the big banks) are estimated to have borrowed at least **5.72M shares of GME** from mutual funds and ETFs. The funds are exposed to potentially catastrophic securities lending counterparty loses. The brokers are also exposed to risks in multiple areas. They are; relending the shares, they own shares in the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.

It's a long post and I believe it is 100% worth the read.

# Background Information

I'm rewording a previous post and adding another fund onto it... Going to try and make it easier to understand.

**Broker dealers are exposed to potentially high $ securities lending counterparty risks from GME and we can see it.** Mutual funds and ETFs (funds) have lent GME shares to broker dealers who in turn lent it out to be shorted. The lending of this security makes the fund and the broker dealer a ""counterparty"", hence ""securities lending counterparty"".

[AIG](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/what-went-wrong-at-aig) suffered roughly $21B in losses from this same business practice in 2008. They would borrow securities from a broker dealer (Citadel & others) and lend them to hedge funds, who would short sell the stock. AIG's counterparties (the brokers) were bailed out [$43.7B](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/aig-bailout-disclosed-counterparties/original.pdf) in 2008.

Thinking of that example, funds are currently lending GME shares to broker dealers who are ***relending*** the security to a hedge fund to be short sold.

The [mutual funds,](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/) and [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks) currently loaning GME, and the *investors* of those funds, have a similar exposure to securities lending counterparty risks as the broker dealers did who were involved in AIG's scheme.

The broker dealers currently borrowing and lending GME have a [similar exposure](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/securities-lending-a-focus-on-two-risk-areas-1495080131) to what AIG's exposure was in 2008, which was famously catastrophic from AIG... I wonder how it will go for the current GME lenders?

What's more, the *investors* of the funds are the very brokers who are borrowing shares from the funds. **They own shares of the ETFs** loaning the GME shares. So, they're exposed as lenders of the securities and as investors in the funds.

And MOAR, some **funds also hold a lot of the brokers OWN shares** (ex. VTI holds 83M shares of JPM - worth $13B)... So, the broker is now exposed to counterparty risk 3 ways...

1. They are borrowing and relending the security,
2. They own shares in the fund which exposes them as *investors* in the fund, AND
3. Many of these funds contain shares of the broker. If the fund needs to liquidate any of these holdings due to their own counterparty loses, the share values will lose money as they're being sold off.

Here are the main stats from the first post I made which showed how much GME was being lent:

* 138 of 213 funds were loaning GME shares
* 70 funds lent out more than 90% of their GME shares
* An estimated 5.72M of total 11.98M GME shares were on loan (this is just loaned securities and does not account for rehypothecated shares or other avenues of securities lending), and
* from the data filing, we were able to see the fund's securities borrowers and how many $ worth of securities they borrowed (this includes all securities, not just GME). We KNOW that someone(s) in the list of borrowers is borrowing GME.
* The primary borrowers of the one fund reviewed (a Fidelity Mutual Fund which had lent $61M worth of GME) were; Morgan Stanley **($911M)**, Goldman Sachs **($454M)**, Citi **($388M)**, BofA **($380M)**, JPMorgan **($321M)**, State Street **($239M)**, Barclays **($115M)**, BNP Paribas **($105M)**, UBS **($56M),** etc.
   * Note: You'll need to see ""GME Deep Dive: So Much GME Lending"" in my profile for the original post with this info. I have it pinned.

That's a lot of $ on loan for just one fund... I'll leave some quotes regarding securities lending counterparty risks at the bottom of this post for additional clarity.

# The Web

**Example 1** of securities lending counterparty risk is the fund which is estimated to have lent out the most GME shares:

**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI)** filed on 3/1/22 for holdings on 12/31/21.

Total GME Shares = 1,847,760

Total GME Shares on Loan ≈ 1,185,700

See the prior post for supporting information on how this was calculated. This fund has a lot of exposure when short sellers fail to return all of their shares during MOASS after the short sellers have been liquidated.

The NPORT-P filing also gives us a list of the fund's securities borrowers along with the value of the securities on loan. This is for all securities, not just GME. Here are this fund's borrowers:

[ Nearly $4B worth of securities on loan to these 24 borrowers ](https://preview.redd.it/7lddv0rb8pr81.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a13147fbe642ce67f51476bec0636f4497fbcd4)

Take a close look at those names... These entities are borrowing the funds then lending them out hedge funds, best case scenario. We don't know for sure which entity is borrowing GME specifically, but someone(s) here is.

I wonder who is investing in this fund if they have counterparty risk as well? As of their last filing, these guys:

[ Well, that's basically the same people plus Citadel ](https://preview.redd.it/88b90mog8pr81.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=56a2fe6803e0f02f217938829139f785e82cc17d)

Nearly $10B worth of this fund's shares are held by the same entities listed as the securities borrowers of the fund.

So wait, the same entities who are borrowing securities from the fund, also own shares of the fund? They have counterparty exposure as fund ***investors*** as well as the ***lending agent***. $ bills are starting to add up a bit.

https://preview.redd.it/o67gkzxc9pr81.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=502bec7e2d34818c3da305caadf38eec9fe83787

The ***fund*** has exposure as well. When short sellers fail to return shares during MOASS, the fund may need to liquidate holdings to keep its head above water. Here are some of the funds holdings:

[ $40B worth of these securities are held by the fund ](https://preview.redd.it/4q0mn82g9pr81.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=6188e2ff74c05db37c78b0ed51acbb6cb033eae5)

Okay, so when short sellers fail to return shares to the lending agent (the banks), and

the banks fail to return the shares to the fund, and

the banks own shares of the ETF, and

the ETF owns shares of the banks... What happens?

Other holdings of this fund include: BNYM, Blackrock Inc, Blackstone, CBRE Group, Cboe Global Markets, CME Group Inc, Charles Schwab Corp, Fidelity National Financial Inc... Just to name a few.

Many other funds loaning GME shares have similar looking securities borrowers, shareholders, and fund holdings compared to the three funds we've just reviewed. That's a lot of securities lending counterparty risk when you considered the amount of funds loaning GME shares (over 5.72M shares by 138 funds).

Remember, this is just lending from mutual funds and ETFs and does not include other avenues for lending GME shares.

# Computershare

Direct Registration is how I am protecting my shares in the event my broker defaults and is liquidated [(741)](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/) from short selling OR securities lending counterparty losses. There's lots of DRS posts out there that will break down the reasons why I feel GME's transfer agent, Computershare, is the best place for my shares.

I'm not telling you that your broker will default. I'm also not telling you to DRS your shares. I'm simply saying that **I feel safest knowing most of my shares are on GME's books at Computershare** because when marge calls and the short sellers are liquidated, that exposure is going to be passed elsewhere, including to the funds and other entities involved in the securities lending listed above, and the other avenues we've done our DD on.

*Buckle Up*

Tanks fo reedin

**Note:** I have not extensively reviewed all funds and fund holdings, but GME appears to be one of the most loaned securities held by these funds, if not the most loaned, BUT there is a SUBSTANTIAL amount of securities lending currently happening with these funds so I can't be certain where GME falls.

**Note 2:** I'll leave the post with these quotes that I used in my original post regarding counterparty risk:

**The Counterparty Risk**

[Deloitte - Securities Lending](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/addressing-securities-lending-risks-with-blockchain.html)

***A typical securities lending transaction involves multiple entities: borrower, lender, lending agent, prime broker, and clearinghouse.*** *Lenders typically include various investment firms, as noted above, whereas, broker-dealers and hedge funds make up the bulk of the borrower group. Lending agents, on the other hand, are broker-dealers, custodial banks, and some large asset management firms as well.*

***In almost every securities lending transaction, lenders are exposed to multiple risks***, such as counterparty default risk, collateral reinvestment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. In particular, counterparty default risk and collateral reinvestment risk seem to have captured the most attention from regulators.

[SEC - Securities Lending by U.S. Open-End and Closed-End Investment Companies](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/securities-lending-open-closed-end-investment-companies.htm)

*Lending agents* ***often*** **(not always)** *indemnify* (protect) *funds against the risk that the borrower will fail to return the borrowed securities (to the extent that the value of the collateral is insufficient to replace the unreturned securities).* ***Lending agents, however, typically do not indemnify funds for losses incurred in connection with cash collateral reinvestment.***

[mutualfunds.com - Securities Lending](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/)

***When a fund lends the stocks,*** *these assets are not actually part of the fund, the put-up collateral is.* ***Typically, U.S. Treasuries or cash is used.*** *However, in recent years everything from mortgage backed securities and derivatives to letters of credit and other exotic I.O.U.’s have become commonplace. These sorts of instruments fluctuate in price and must be marked-to-market daily. That can actually affect the net asset value of the mutual fund if they swing rapidly. An additional risk is if the mutual fund invests that money in something less than desirable to juice returns.*

*Secondly, if the collateral drops in value by too much, the investor borrowing the shares may be forced to add additional collateral or cover the short early. If they can’t,* ***the mutual fund and its investors are on the hook for the damage.***

The same thought process for [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks).

426,Tesla stock pops after plans to enable another stock split,,"Shares of shot up Monday, after the electric vehicle giant disclosed plans to enable a stock split, which would be the second in two years.

The company TSLA, -0.32% said in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will ask shareholders to approve an increase in the number of shares outstanding. The request will be made at its 2022 annual shareholders meeting expected in October.

The stock rallied 5.8% in premarket trading, putting them on track to open at the highest price seen during regular-session hours since Jan. 13. It slipped 0.3% on Friday to close at $1,010.64, to snap an eight-day winning streak. Monday’s rally comes even after a report that Tesla will pause production in China amid new COVID-19 lockdowns.

Tesla had 1.033 billion shares outstanding as of Jan. 31. In the 2021 proxy statement, the company said it is authorized to have 2.00 billion shares outstanding.

The company’s only other stock split, a 5-to-1 split, took effect on Aug. 31, 2020. At that time, the stock was trading at a pre-split-adjusted price of about $2,213. The stock closed Aug. 31 at split-adjusted $498.32.

To lower the stock price to around that level, Tesla would have to increase number of shares it is authorized to have outstanding by more than 1 billion, so it could enact a 2-for-1 split. To match the previous 5-for-1 split, the number of authorized shares outstanding would have to increase by more than 3 billion.

Although a stock split doesn’t change anything about a companies fundamentals, it has historically helped boost the stock price as it is viewed as a sign of management’s confidence that the stock will continue to perform well, as Mark Hulbert has written for MarketWatch.

Tesla’s stock had soared 78% from the time the company said after the Aug. 11 close that it approved a 5-for-1 stock split through Aug. 31, but then fell 33.7% over the next week. The stock didn’t close back above the Aug. 31 closing price until Nov. 19.

Tesla’s stock has lost 4.4% year to date through Friday, but has soared 63.4% over the past 12 months. In comparison, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.51% has gained 14.3% over the past year.

Reddit has announced they are doing it again this year and I think we have the numbers to go for the prime spot.   Right in the middle.  We will need everyone's effort as this spot will be highly contested and will need to be defended against vandals but overall is a really good time as well as a good chance to get to know each other.

We will be going for something like this:

Interest rates on mortgages are rising sharply while the average adjusted disposable houshold income is dropping sharply due to inflation, which combined with sentiment in the market could mean a turning point on the housing markets. For a variety of reasons the reported decrease in prices isn't as significant as it might seem, but it might be an early sign we're approaching a potential turning point on the housing markets worldwide. Inflation in the Netherlands is rising extremely quick, from 1,4% in July to 11,9% in March, an indication the reduction in adjusted disposable income and rises in interest rates on martgages aren't temporary.

452,Russian Stock Market to Partially Reopen on Thursday,,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-stock-market-prepares-for-an-unusual-reopening-11648023739

> Russia’s stock market is set to have a partial reopening Thursday, nearly a month after it shut down following the invasion of Ukraine. 
The challenge for Moscow is that the resumption of trading could simply send Russian stocks back into free fall. On Feb. 24, the day when President Vladimir Putin began the assault on Ukraine, the main Russian stock index tumbled 33%. While the index regained a fraction of those losses on Feb. 25—its last day of trading—that was before Western sanctions hammered the ruble and sent the country into an economic crisis.

>To limit the fallout, Moscow has turned to some heavy-handed policies. It blocked foreign investors from dumping local stocks—a move that some market participants saw as retaliation for a Western freeze on Russian central bank assets since a big chunk of the Russian market is owned by foreigners. The Russian government ordered its main sovereign-wealth fund to buy billions of dollars worth of shares. 

>The Russian stock market could ultimately look very different than it did before, with a plan under discussion to split it into separate markets for foreign and local investors, according to a person familiar with the matter.

>Russia’s central bank said Wednesday that it will allow trading of 33 shares out of 50 included in the benchmark stock index, the MOEX, on Thursday from 9:50 a.m. to 2 p.m. Moscow time. Among the companies to be traded are Gazprom PJSC and Lukoil PJSC. Bets on the fall of a stock, known as short-selling, will be banned.

>Under a policy announced by the central bank on Feb. 28, Russian brokerages aren’t allowed to let foreign clients sell securities. This will prevent foreigners from bolting for the exits as soon as the market reopens, which could be ruinous because of their outsize role in Russian stocks. International institutional investors held about three-quarters of the Russian market’s free float as of February 2020, according to Sberbank Investment Research.

>That has raised concerns that the market will be skewed by the absence of foreign investors, who accounted for nearly half of equities trading volume at the Moscow Exchange in the first half of last year.
“There will be an illusion of a working, recovering Russian stock market, even though a huge class of players in the market—foreigners—won’t have the opportunity to sell,” said Vladimir Kreyndel, CEO of ETF Consulting, a Moscow firm that advises issuers of exchange-traded funds. 

>Among the Western investors that held Russian stocks before the freeze were asset-management giants Vanguard Group and Fidelity International. Both firms have said they are reducing exposure to Russia.
Due to the freeze, foreign investors won’t have much to do when the stock market reopens. 

>But the plan under consideration by Russian officials—which is still in the discussion stages—would effectively split the country’s securities market in two, with one market for foreigners and another for local investors, the person familiar with the matter said. In this arrangement, foreign investors could sell their shares or bonds, but would face restrictions on moving the proceeds out of Russia because of capital controls that Moscow has imposed since February, the person said.

>Such a bifurcated market could result in oddities, such as the same stock having two different prices. That isn’t completely unprecedented. In China, there have long been discrepancies between shares on mainland exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen and those listed in Hong Kong.
It could also prevent further erosion of the ruble’s value. Russia’s currency has stabilized in recent sessions to trade near 104 rubles to the dollar, though it remains 22% weaker than before Russia invaded Ukraine.

>“The biggest fear is that the central bank is under sanctions and they don’t want foreign investors to sell their shares and take the ruble and buy hard currency,” said Jacob Grapengiesser, head of Eastern Europe at emerging markets fund manager East Capital.

>The Moscow Exchange said Monday that it would allow for the settlement of trades that foreign investors had placed before Feb. 28 that were still being processed. Mr. Grapengiesser said his firm had trades still awaiting settlement from the start of the war that he expects to go through soon. 

>“It’s a natural step before opening the market. You need to take care of those unsettled trades,” he said. “Things are slowly moving forward.”
Shortly after the war began, Russia’s prime minister ordered the country’s National Wealth Fund to buy up to one trillion rubles, equivalent to $9.38 billion, worth of shares this year. Analysts also expect some Russian oil companies to prop up their share prices with buyback programs.

>Local investors may buy stocks too. When Russia invaded Crimea, the MOEX fell almost 18% between mid-February and mid-March of 2014. But by the end of that year, it had rebounded more than 12% from that March low. The broad index has posted gains in all but one year since 2014. Stocks in unstable countries can also serve as hedges against inflation because locals expect companies can offset rising costs by charging higher prices.

>The government’s efforts have led some to be cautiously optimistic about the reopening. “Initially, I think there will be a moderate correction,” said Natalia Smirnova, a financial adviser in Moscow. “But I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that the first day could end up with a modest increase.”

>Russia is a minnow of a financial market by global terms. In December 2021, the total market capitalization of companies listed on the Moscow Exchange was about $842 billion, according to the World Federation of Exchanges, which is just under 90% of the current value of Tesla Inc. That made the Moscow Exchange the 20th largest bourse by market cap, just above Brazil’s B3 exchange, in the WFE’s ranking of global exchanges.

>Until the war, Russia mostly attracted attention from specialist emerging-market funds and hedge funds, though it made up only a fraction of holdings for most globally minded investors. 

>MSCI Inc. said it would drop Russian stocks from its influential indexes that track emerging markets. Before the war, MSCI’s emerging market index had a 2.8% weighting for Russia. FTSE Russell has also announced plans to remove Russian stocks from its indexes. The moves will force investors whose holdings track the indexes to sell—when they can. 
Wars have led to stock-market shutdowns before, although it is unusual. The New York Stock Exchange closed for about four months when World War I broke out in 1914, the longest closure in the NYSE’s history. The Beirut Stock Exchange reopened in 1996 after a nearly 13-year shutdown caused by Lebanon’s civil war.",tkued5,1075,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tkued5/russian_stock_market_to_partially_reopen_on/

459,"Why inflation is about to get out of control, and no amount or rate raising Is going to stop it.",Discussion,"Good morning. 
This is just starting to get picked up by the media, but I don't believe anyone has realized the scale of what's about to happen. 

You've seen sanctions take a toll on gas prices, and this has already brought you more inflation on top of your post pandemic inflation. This was just the beginning. Now it's time for your pocketbooks to hurt. 

Russia and Ukraine are two of the world's biggest exporters of grain. Russian has banned grain exports, and as for Ukraine, it's hard as fuck to grow that shit when tanks are rolling through your fields and you gotta use your tractor to steal em, instead of planting. How do you play this? Well if you are in Africa you better stock up on food because you are about to have none. Turns out African countries and countries like Lebanon are the biggest importers of Ukrainian and Russian grains. Expect to see massive famine in these parts of the world. 

Ok, but what do I care? I'm not poor! Well here is some bad news. Grain scarcity is gonna drive up your food prices. Expect even more inflation in the grocery stores. 

Ok so no big deal, let's increase production in other countries. Well that's easier said than done. Food production required significant inputs. Those tractors need deisel. Those prices are already skyrocketed. You need food to feed livestock. Corn and other commodities have skyrocketed. Oh and one last thing. You need fertilizer. Who is the world's largest exporters of fertilizer you ask? Well, guess what. It's Russia. They've banned exports. Ok well let's get fertilizer from somewhere else! Who is another major exporter? Belarus. Also banned exports. Well let's buy from YARA, one of Europes biggest producers! Well no, there cut production due to skyrocketing natural gas prices. Well let's increase our output of natural gas. Well no, Europe's destroyed all that infrastructure ( thanks to Russian funded lobbiests and environmental groups). 
So with skyrocketing costs of fertilizer, and grain, and gas, we are fucked. Expect mass starvation in Latin America ( Brazil is largest importer of Russian fertilizer) and Africa. Expect prices to skyrocket in Europe and in north America. 
Expect massive rate hikes to control inflation ( won't help) 


My time frame: 90 days. 
My inflation estimate, 12-20%

So can we do anything to solve this? 
No. It's too late to do anything. Planting is already happening and many farmers are choosing not to due to high prices. Even if sanctions are lifted tomorrow, fertilizer doesn't just magically appear in Brazil from Russia. Grain doesn't just magically make its way to Africa. So far we have done nothing to increase our food production to account for this. Why 90 days? The world Operates on a 90 day supply of food. If we stop producing today, that's all we have left. 90 days. Expect by July to see massive price increases. 

How do you play this? 
I don't know, that's why it's a discussion not DD. 
Spy doesn't seem to have this priced in. 
GM puts may be a good option (rate raises, plus high gas prices, plus gm is not well positioned for hybrid/ electric) 
I wouldn't touch commodities, it seems the only area with an idea that this is coming. 
Good luck and if you bake, stock up on your flour now.",tk5zsm,1045,713,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tk5zsm/why_inflation_is_about_to_get_out_of_control_and/

471,"Tesla delivers 310,048 electric vehicles in the first quarter, below analyst estimates",,"TESLA TO THE MOON! Apparently y’all thought this was a hit job on Tesla? I’m bullish 

Tesla delivered 310,048 electric vehicles in the first quarter of 2022, below analysts estimates.

Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales numbers reported by Tesla.

After a rough start to 2022, Tesla shares are now up for the year as of Thursday’s close.

Electric vehicle deliveries (total): 310,048

Electric vehicle production (total): 305,407

Over the same period last year, Tesla delivered 184,800 electric vehicles and produced 180,338 cars.

Analysts expected deliveries of 317,000 vehicles for the first three months of 2022, according to estimates compiled by FactSet as of March 31. The estimates ranged from a low of 278,000 vehicle deliveries to a high of 357,000.

Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales numbers reported by Tesla.

The company recently opened a new factory in Brandenburg, Germany, and had a ribbon-cutting ceremony on March 22. Tesla also plans to host a grand opening and “cyber rodeo” event on April 7, at another new vehicle assembly plant it’s building in Austin, Texas.

Tesla moved its headquarters to Austin officially as of Dec. 1, but still operates its first electric car factory in Fremont, California.

Globally, Tesla’s operations during the quarter, which ended March 31, were weighed down by a Covid surge and new health restrictions in China, requiring temporary production halts at its Shanghai plant. In the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 308,600 EVs, marking a record for the company. 

Tesla, along with the rest of the auto industry, has also been hurt by widespread parts shortages, and inflation. Critical components like semiconductors remain in short supply, and prices have increased for raw materials like nickel and aluminum after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine in February. In the U.S., Tesla has been leaving customers waiting for months before filling their car orders.

486,Reluctant to invest in real estate because it may be immoral.,,"Hear me out. It’s not any one person’s fault. But housing has become relatively unaffordable for the working class. Real estate has become a store of value in a way it shouldn’t partially due to the incentives in place resulting from our monetary policy. In the 80s, you could make double digit returns in a savings account. Now, savings accounts are negative real yield and significantly so. Again, this is not the fault of real estate investors. They’re just playing the game with the rules presented. 

I’m a small business owner with ~30 employees, and I see their struggles. My workers are not minimum wage, either. As I’ve been investing my money I’m frequently tempted to buy a rental as part of a diversified strategy, and I’ve done it before. 

But if I become a landlord, I “have” to directly participate in the inflationary market that makes housing less and less affordable for the working class. I don’t like that. 

Equities are less directly a problem because it’s less of a zero sum. Everyone can participate. But everyone “needs” housing. 

So, my chosen investments have been equities and Bitcoin. I’m not here to “orange pill” anyone. I just see these as open systems that don’t necessarily promote wealth inequality like real estate seems to.

Can someone show me how I’m wrong from a moral standpoint assuming I care about the wealth of the working class? I’m still tempted to add rentals to my strategy. It just feels wrongish atm. 

Open to contrary perspectives.


EDIT: Ok. So, for the first time, I understand what ""RIP my Inbox"" means. One small clarification. I am using the context of investment. So, the idea of charging less than cost is more like charity to me. That's fine! But, that's not what I'm talking about. I'll show you the napkin math. Median per capita income in my area is about 38k. Small (sub 1000 sqft) SFHs or condo in the same area start at $350k. With a 20% down payment, Cost comes in right about 1600 per month. This is right about 50% of GROSS income for a person here without any profit built in. Just pretty ugly. Now, a person can get help, they can buy with a partner or a family member, etc. I understand. But, the starting place is pretty ugly. So, it feels wrong to participate in that. If you're a median family of two it works okish until you add a child.",tt1lyx,975,810,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tt1lyx/reluctant_to_invest_in_real_estate_because_it_may/

At 20:30, the annual rate of the US CPI in March was non-seasonally adjusted, the previous value was 7.90%, and the expected 8.4% was announced at 8.5%.

&#x200B;

As of 8:30 p.m., the U.S. reported a post-quarter adjusted monthly CPI of 0.80% in March, compared to expectations of 1.2% and 1.2%, respectively.

&#x200B;

Among them, the annual rate of non-seasonally adjusted CPI in the United States in March exceeded 8%, reaching 8.5%, a new high since December 1981. This is the highest point in 40 years, indicating that our inflation is already serious. Serious.

Governments are printing money 50% faster over the past three years, including supply chain issues, Covid-19 issues, higher oil prices, higher food prices, and finally our inflation is getting worse.

&#x200B;

At this rate of development, if our CPI soon exceeds 10%, perhaps in the near future, it may lead to a global economic crisis or a severe financial crisis.

Fears that Chinese companies could face US sanctions over ties with Russia had contributed to an epic sell-off in Chinese stocks recent days. That slump was reversed Wednesday when Beijing promised it would pursue policies to boost its sputtering economy and keep financial markets stable.

Analysts say that China is attempting to strike ""a delicate balance"" between supporting Russia rhetorically but without further antagonizing the United States.

Beijing and Moscow share a strategic interest in challenging the West. However, Chinese banks cannot afford to lose access to US dollars, and many Chinese industries cannot afford to be deprived of US technology.

While China is Russia's No. 1 trading partner, Beijing has other priorities. Trade between the two countries made up just 2% of China's total trade volume. The European Union and the United States have much larger shares, according to Chinese customs statistics from last year.

China's currency, the yuan, doesn't trade completely freely, moving instead within bands set by officials at the People's Bank of China (PBOC). Last week, they doubled the size of the ruble trading range, allowing the Russian currency to fall faster.

If China allowed Moscow to convert its yuan reserves into US dollars or euros, ""that would clearly help Russia's current impasse,"" García-Herrero noted. However, ""the reputational risk of potentially breaching Western sanctions would be a huge step for the PBOC to take and therefore makes it highly unlikely,"" she said.

""The long-term gains of moving closer to Russia might not match the impact of Western investors suddenly losing interest in China,"" she added.

In response to CNN's request for comment, China's foreign ministry reiterated Beijing's opposition to sanctions adding that China and Russia will maintain ""normal economic and trade cooperation.""",thea35,941,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/thea35/china_is_not_a_party_to_the_ukraine_crisis_and/

>The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.2 percent
in March on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.8 percent in February,
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months,
the all items index increased 8.5 percent before seasonal adjustment.

>Increases in the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food were the largest
contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The gasoline
index rose 18.3 percent in March and accounted for over half of the all items
monthly increase; other energy component indexes also increased. The food index
rose 1.0 percent and the food at home index rose 1.5 percent. 

>The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3 percent in March following
a 0.5-percent increase the prior month. The shelter index was by far the biggest
factor in the increase, with a broad set of other indexes also contributing,
including those for airline fares, household furnishings and operations, medical
care, and motor vehicle insurance. In contrast, the index for used cars and
trucks fell 3.8 percent over the month.

Russia could soon be forced to curtail crude oil production by 30%, subjecting the global economy to the biggest supply crisis in decades — that is, unless Saudi Arabia and other major energy exporters start pumping more.

The world's second-largest crude oil exporter could be forced to limit output by 3 million barrels per day in April, the International Energy Agency warned on Wednesday, as major oil companies, trading houses and shipping companies shun its exports and demand in Russia slumps. Russia was pumping about 10 million barrels of crude per day, and exporting about half of that, before it invaded Ukraine.

""The implications of a potential loss of Russian oil exports to global markets cannot be understated,"" the IEA said in its monthly report. The crisis could bring lasting changes to energy markets, it added.

The IEA, which monitors energy market trends for the world's richest nations, said that refiners are now scrambling to find alternative supply sources. They could be forced to reduce their activity just as global consumers are hit with higher gasoline prices.

So far, there's little sign of relief. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the only producers with significant spare capacity. Both countries are part of the 23-member OPEC+ coalition, which also includes Russia. OPEC+ has been increasing its collective output by a modest 400,000 barrels per day in recent months, but often fails to meet its own targets.

""The long-running inability of the bloc to meet its agreed quotas, mostly due to technical issues and other capacity constraints, has already led to sharp draws in global inventories,"" the IEA said. If major producers do not change course and open the taps wider, global markets will be under supplied in the second and third quarters of 2022, the agency warned.",tg0bxf,927,243,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tg0bxf/russia_could_lose_30_of_its_oil_output_within/

Orders for U.S durable goods — products meant to last at least three years — shrank for the first time in five months, the government said Thursday. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal had forecast 1% decline.

The dropoff was concentrated in passenger planes and autos, two volatile categories that can swing sharply from one month to the next. Yet bookings were soft in every major category except for computers. A more accurate measure of demand, known as core orders, slipped 0.3% in the month. The core number strips out transportation and military hardware. It was first decline in 12 months.

**Big picture:** Businesses still have plenty of demand for big-ticket items despite high inflation and disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Orders for durable goods have climbed 10% over the past year. Headwinds are growing, however.

The conflict in Ukraine could tax already strained global supply chains, as could a coronavirus outbreak in China. At home, the Federal Reserve is moving to raise interest rates to try to bring down high inflation.

Economists predict U.S. growth will slow this year, but keep expanding at a steady pace.

515,The GME dividend stock split and you.,already posted recently,"Disclaimer: I do not currently hold ANY GameStop stock and haven’t for over a year.

Ok so by now you may know GME is considering a stock split in the form of a *dividend*. We need to take a closer look at why the dividend matters.

In the case of a normal stock split, all shares and positions are split. Even split, no change in value. Essentially everybody gets a smaller slice of the pie but all their slices have the same value—this includes short positions.

Now in the case of a share dividend, let’s say  
Person A - owns 10 shares of GME  
Person B - shorts 10 shares of GME  
Person C - counter-party that buys the 10 shorted shares from Person B  

Person A and Person C technically own the same 10 shares simultaneously. In the case of a dividend split, Person C’s shares will be split and they now own 30. However, Person A’s split shares already went to Person C. So it is *Person B’s responsibility to BUY enough shares to make Person A whole again*. Essentially, this dividend will force shorts hands to cover their position prior to the ex-div date. Very smart by move by RC.

The dividend goes up for a vote by the board on 6/9 lol. 

Special dividend have caused short squeezes in the past, see examples as $OSTK or $BGFV. If you believe that short interest in GME is still high, this could be an interesting play.

House Formally Advances Federal Marijuana Legalization Bill For Floor Vote, With Praise From Pelosi

By: Kyle Jaeger March 31st 2022

The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved the final rule to advance a bill to federally legalize marijuana to a floor vote, which is expected to happen on Friday.

Members on both sides of the aisle were given the chance to debate the final rule for the process to consider the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act that was approved by the House Rules Committee on Wednesday. And Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), who served as manager of the rule for the floor debate, took the opportunity to put pressure on the Senate to finally act on cannabis reform.

https://www.marijuanamoment.net/house-begins-debate-on-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill-with-praise-from-pelosi-ahead-of-floor-vote/

{ ""The House is acting again this week to urge the Senate to finally pass meaningful cannabis reform legislation,"" Perlmutter said, adding that the House has passed his more incremental marijuana banking reform bill six times without seeing action in the opposite chamber.

""The House will pass the MORE Act this week,"" he said. ""It is clear that Congress needs to reform our broken cannabis laws to better respond to the 47 states across the country who have [legalized] some level of marijuana use."" }



Edit: April 1st 2022

The House is once again poised to pass legislation to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level.

The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, known as the MORE Act, would remove marijuana from the controlled substances list, leaving it up to states to set their own laws. It would also release people incarcerated on cannabis-related offenses of less than 30 grams and expunge criminal penalties associated with those who manufacture, distribute and possess it.

# Not financial advice, Manage risk

I'm going to walk you through very methodically why Twitter is doomed and why Elon can't and won't save it with heavy DD. If anything, he's a major catalyst to accelerate this process so I've taken the time to explain it here. I've categorized each section incase your brain is too smooth to understand one of the sections like the profit margins etc.

Also, Elon's  Tweets today are ... well just look for yourself..

# I keep getting comments about this

Twitter is already dead, the institutions holding twitter hold it for heavy influence of the consumers. That stock and its financials don't mean much to them other than this. IMHO;nfa

Gonna post this again at the top

>Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules,” the company said in an unattributed statement. “**Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.**“ As always,” the statement added, ""our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service. Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.”

Yes I know it's a lie, connect the dots, it's easy.

&#x200B;

# Quick Recap Since April Fool's Day

&#x200B;

Let's start here since this is undoubtedly where most of the smooth brains heard about this.

Elon took a 9.2% stake in twitter as reported  Mon Apr 4. while most of you were sleeping at 3 in the morning the stock gapped up \~27% via 13-G filing which is required for anyone who purchases more than 5% of a company. This publicly and officially discloses big ownership stakes.

When smooth brains heard this they thought 'wow Elon musk is in must be going to the moon' so they bought the top and pushed it up another few percent, some smooth brains got out for tiny profit. Others got dumped on and got left holding the bag or sold for a loss because there was zero conviction or research into this play other than, such stake, much wow.

Some geniuses in this sub predicted it perfectly down to the timeline and price action how it would get dumped. Major congrats to you to being well versed in retard timelines and I hope you are still holding those puts because we've got a lot further to go down imo

# Wendy's Laws of Tendies Applies

&#x200B;

Should of simply applied:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rzdwr7/guide\_wendys\_laws\_of\_tendies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rzdwr7/guide_wendys_laws_of_tendies/)

>**1st Law of Wendy's: Mass stupidity.** Assume everyone and you is retarded. The sooner you understand we are all natural born crayon eaters the sooner you are on the path to tendieland. Never trust anyone or yourself, at first. If something seems retarded to you at first, it's probably genius. The inverse is also true, if you or others think it's genius at first glance it's probably retarded. Same thing if you see other people saying that. I don't care who they are. Do more research into it. Figure out how retarded everyone is so you can replace those crayon dinners with chicken feasts.

Now it's time to go one step further and apply

>**2nd Law of Wendy's: Confusion.** The more confusing and convoluted the information is the likelier it is you'll make big tendies. Big words and vocabulary you don't really understand means it's above your paygrade and therefore likely the opposite of retarded. Learn more about it and see if it's worth buying.

# What Can Or Will Elon Do, And What Can't or Won't He Do

&#x200B;

I've seen a lot of next level retarded shit about Elon saving Twitter all over the internet.

**Let's lay out the facts**

1. Twitter is 77%+ owned by institutions [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/twtr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/twtr/institutional-holdings)
2. Elon is the 'single largest holder' but that doesn't mean much since you need 50.1%+  of a company to 'control it'
3. You cannot do a hostile take over of Twitter because of who owns it.
4. Twitter's Board in a statement put this out (yes I know it's a lie, they can control it, point is they are not going to and they aren't there to make money directly off of TWTR)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jwao7j47is81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52eb68361bde139f763d168655f4c0fe89d3766c

Meaning Twitter stock is worthless since the employees run the company and Elon doesn't get to decide shit. Same ownership. Same Management.

5. The **CEO** and the rest of the company doesn't believe in this stuff

>**Parag Agrawal:** Our role is not to  be bound by the First Amendment but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation and our moves are reflective of things that we believe lead to a healthier public conversation. The kinds of things that we do to work about this is to focus less on thinking about free speech, but thinking about how the times have changed. One of the changes today that we see is speech is easy on the internet. Most people can speak but our role w**hich is particularly emphasized is who can be heard.**

6. Elon is also capped at 14.8% ownership being a board member. But it doesn't matter because the 77% of the other institutions are not giving up their stakes. I'll get into that more later

Now that we laid out some facts lets talk about some implications of this

**Elon cannot and will not change twitter in any meaningful way,** the company does not care about the share holders or even making money. They care about their activism. Ownership is onboard with this and is going to subsidize  (like CNN etc.) and **continue running it in the direction that it has been going in.** And even if they didn't, a lot of the population will not ever trust TWTR again, and a lot of the population (esp on Twitter) does not like Elon at all. Just look into that yourself if you don't believe me, I know it's hard to believe

&#x200B;

# So what is the current direction of Twitter?

Twitter is going down the tubes for a number of very important reasons.

&#x200B;

# Lets look at the financials and KPIs

First let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet

Starting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020\_Twitter\_Annual\_Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf)

We can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services, 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue

1.37B Cost revenue

873M in 'Research and development'

888M in 'Sales and marketing'

562M in 'general and administrative'

Twitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.

Let's break this down again

Twitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent

37% on cost of revenue: servers, buildings, upkeep etc.

23% on Research and development: software engineers, sociologists, artists, focus groups (market research) (I believe moderators is in here as well)

24% on Sales and marketing: sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.

15% of general and administrative: executives, legal, finance, info tech, hr, consulting, moderators (in both categories probably), customer service etc.

3% on interest and other: interest on debt financing, operations etc.

29% on taxes.

Yes these numbers add to 131% of revenue or in other words a 31% net income loss.

Why is Twitter so expensive to run, why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money?

Lets go back in time to Twitter in 2011-2013 - Here's the same report from that time period. [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf)

Page 57

Going to compare to Twitters Monthly active users (MAU) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:\~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)).

2013: \~225M monthly active users (MAU)

Cost of Revenue : 266 M (\~330M inflation adjusted)

Research and Development.(R&D): 593M (\~740M inflation adjusted)Sales and Marketing 316M (\~400M inflation adjusted)General and Administrative 124M (\~160M inflation adjusted)

2011: \~100M MAU

Cost of Revenue: 62M (\~85M inflation adjusted)

R&D: 80M (\~110M inflation adjusted)

Sales and marketing 26M (\~36M inflation adjusted)

General and administrative 233M (\~310M inflation adjusted)

Ok so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users

2020: \~330M MAU

Cost of revenue: \~$4.15 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$2.65 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: $2.7 per monthly active user

General and admin: $1.7 per monthly active user

2013: \~225M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)

Cost of revenue: \~$1.47 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$3.29 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: \~$1.78 per monthly active user

General and admin: \~$0.71 per monthly active user

2011: \~100M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)

Cost of revenue: \~$0.85 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$1.10 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: \~$0.36 per monthly active user

General and admin: \~$0.85 per monthly active user

So what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.

Let's recap

Cost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **388% increase**

R&D went from $1.10/user in 2011 to $2.65/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **141% increase**

Sales and marketing went from $0.36/user in 2011 to $2.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **650% increase**

And general and admin from $0.85/user in 2011 to $1.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **100% increase**

As you can see, twitter suffers from huge inflated costs over the years of running their business.

I suspect this has a lot to do with financing of their servers through amortization payments.

But also trying to scale their business with the technology that was available 10+ years ago and not being able to change their business model because it was bad PR to fire off thousands people and replace them with future technology, they've essentially been forced to grow with their existing business modeling scaling up which you can see results in worse and eventually negative margins.

Twitter has 5,500 employees (1 employee for every \~60,000 users)

This is one of the things they fear more is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare. (by their other competitors I won't mention here just yet)

Facebook has all of these similar issues with growing costs and declining growth etc.

587,GME - You MIGHT have to be a shareholder by early or mid-April to vote on the stock dividend plan in the annual meeting in June,DD | GME,"(I am not a financial advisor, this is PURELY speculative information for anyone interested to keep in mind)

**TL;DR - If this year's timeline resembles last year's, then you** ***might*** **have to be a GME shareholder by either April 7th or 14th to vote in the annual meeting where the stock dividend vote will occur.**

So now that we've all heard about GameStop's stock dividend plan, I figured I'd share a quick speculation which could be crucial for those who are not GME shareholders but plan to be at some point so that they can vote in the annual meeting. 

Below is the email I received from Fidelity in **May of 2021** regarding the GameStop annual meeting. You had to have been a shareholder as of **April 15th, 2021** in order to vote in the meeting. Note that the email notice was sent to me AFTER the deadline to be a shareholder. 

https://preview.redd.it/0xoprcsw26r81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1e4923f4a9b557031aaa184c7bc682294b0a828

Now let's assume that this year's timeline was to mirror last year's. Since this year's meeting is at around the same time as last year's (I've heard it was on June 9th, but could be June 2nd, I don't know which is right), then it might be the case that you'd have to be a shareholder by either April 7th (for a June 2nd meeting) or April 14th (for a June 9th meeting). Unfortunately, you may get notified about this AFTER the deadline to become a shareholder if you started owning shares too late. 

Again, this is pure speculation, anything could be different this year. But I wanted to share this for those who would not want to take any chances by waiting for the last minute and then realizing they cannot vote. I personally believe that this would be the case, and am currently a GME shareholder. 

**TL;DR - If this year's timeline resembles last year's, then you** ***might*** **have to be a GME shareholder by either April 7th or 14th to vote in the annual meeting where the stock dividend vote will occur.**

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on Tuesday that he and colleagues are in the process of reaching out to Republican senators to “see what they want” included in a bill to federally legalize marijuana he’s planning to introduce later this month.

https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-talking-to-gop-to-see-what-they-want-in-marijuana-legalization-bill-coming-this-month/

“We hope to [file the bill] towards the end of April,” Schumer said, adding that he, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) “are talking about it and, in fact, we’re trying to reach out” to other lawmakers about the forthcoming bill.

“I’ve reached out already to a few Republicans to see what they want,” he said.

The senators’ proposal as released in draft form last year would federally deschedule cannabis, expunge prior convictions, allow people to petition for resentencing, maintain the authority of states to set their own marijuana policies and remove collateral consequences like immigration-related penalties for people who’ve been criminalized over the plant.

In 1980 when Volcker raised rates by 20% to fight high inflation, our national debt was at $908 billion ($3 trillion today if adjusted for inflation) and it was 30% of the national GDP so raising rates was still affordable.

Today, when we are running at $30 trillion of debt with $23 trillion of GDP or 139% ratio, raising rates to levels anywhere near Volcker's levels is simply impossible - the country will go tits up the same day. We simply will not be able to service our debt at high rates

605,House approves bill legalizing marijuana,News,"https://thehill.com/news/house/3256370-house-approves-bill-legalizing-marijuana/

The House passed legislation on Friday to legalize marijuana nationwide and eliminate the longstanding criminal penalties for anyone who distributes or possesses it. 

Lawmakers passed the bill largely along party lines, 220-204, with three Republicans joining all but two Democrats in support.

The measure now goes to the Senate, where Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) is working with fellow Democrats to introduce a marijuana legalization bill as soon as this spring.  

But it’s not clear a bill to broadly legalize marijuana could clear the necessary 60 votes to advance in the Senate.

Schumer may not have enough support within his own Democratic caucus. At least two Democrats who represent states ravaged by the opioid epidemic, Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), have expressed skepticism about the proposal.   

Schumer may not have enough support within his own Democratic caucus. At least two Democrats who represent states ravaged by the opioid epidemic, Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), have expressed skepticism about the proposal. 

House Democrats previously passed a bill to legalize marijuana in December 2020. But that measure didn’t go anywhere in the Senate, which was still under GOP control at the time.    

The bill, titled the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, would clear marijuana-related convictions from people’s records and formally remove it from the federal list of controlled substances. 

The legislation would also impose a federal tax on marijuana sales to fund programs aimed at helping communities harmed by the so-called “war on drugs” policies that established harsh punishments for distributing and using drugs.  

The sales tax would start at 5 percent, and gradually increase to 8 percent over five years. 

Proponents argued that it’s past time for the federal government to catch up to the majority of states that have legalized marijuana to at least some extent. 

“For far too long, we have treated marijuana as a criminal justice problem instead of as a matter of personal choice and public health,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chief sponsor of the bill.  

“If states are the laboratories of democracy, it is long past time for the federal government to recognize that legalization has been a resounding success and the conflict with federal law has become untenable,” Nadler said. 

Before final passage, the House rejected an amendment from Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) to clarify that people can’t be denied security clearances over marijuana use due to 12 Democrats joining all but two Republicans in opposition.

Democrats further framed the measure as a way to reverse the disproportionate impact of criminalizing marijuana on racial minorities. Black Americans are nearly four times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession despite both races using the drug at roughly the same rate, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. 

“Make no mistake. Yes, it is a racial justice bill,” said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), a Congressional Cannabis Caucus co-chair and member of the Congressional Black Caucus. 

Republicans argued that marijuana is enough of a mind-altering substance to pose a threat to society.       

“Record crime, record inflation, record gas prices, record number of illegal immigrants crossing our southern border, and what are Democrats doing today? Legalizing drugs. Legalizing drugs and using American tax dollars to kick start and prop up the marijuana industry. Wow,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. 

At least 37 states, four territories and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for medical use, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. About half that number – 18 states, two territories and the nation’s capital – allow it for non-medical use. 

Some Republicans who support legalizing marijuana opposed House Democrats’ bill on Friday, arguing there should have been a more bipartisan approach. 

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) called for bringing the legislation on the House floor on Friday closer to her own marijuana legalization bill, which would limit marijuana use to people above the age of 21 and establish a lower sales tax that would not rise for ten years. 

“I have incentives for states not to sell to kids or market or advertise to kids,” Mace told The Hill. “My tax is a lot lower at 3 percent. Theirs is eight after three years, and we all know that you’re going to guarantee illicit markets if you make taxes too high.” 

Rep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio), a Congressional Cannabis Caucus co-chair, wrote in an op-ed for Marijuana Moment, a publication that focuses on marijuana policy, that he would not support the bill on Friday either. 

“To responsibly end prohibition, the federal government must simultaneously issue a regulatory framework that works in conjunction with states’ specifics needs. The MORE Act lacks this critical element or any meaningful and immediate regulatory safeguards at all, leaving individual states to sort out issues typically reserved for federal agencies in the interim,” Joyce wrote. 

The House has passed legislation multiple times in the past year to allow legally operating marijuana businesses to access banking services and credit cards, so that they don’t have to be cash-only. So far, nine Senate Republicans have signed on as cosponsors to Sen. Jeff Merkley’s (D-Ore.) companion bill in the upper chamber for more narrow marijuana legalization.",ttvz3f,702,182,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ttvz3f/house_approves_bill_legalizing_marijuana/

But it has struggled over the past year, with the stock falling more than 46% over the past year.

Etsy has a base of 5.3 million businesses, or sellers, on its platform. When those sellers make a sale through Etsy.com, they will now be charged a transaction fee of 6.5% of the price displayed for each listing, plus the amount charged for shipping and gift wrapping. The fee hike is the[ first of its type since 2018. ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/etsy-sellers-strike-as-site-ramps-up-to-battle-amazon-11649681740?mod=hp_lead_pos4)The fee previously was 5%.

Sellers began discussing the fee hikes nearly two months ago on a [Reddit thread for Etsy sellers](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/t0ltfi/yikes_etsy_raising_transaction_fees_to_65/), expressing anger over the situation and questioning the company’s true motives. The conversations then led to the strike.

Etsy didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.

Etsy executives have said previously that the[ increases are needed for investments](https://s22.q4cdn.com/941741262/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Exhibit-99.1-12.31.2021.pdf) in marketing and other seller-based tools.",u1an30,702,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u1an30/etsy_sellers_start_strike_over_rising_transaction/

611,"One year ago, I wrote a bear case for AMD. Let's review.",Company Analysis,"**About me:** I like to write about semiconductor companies and tech stocks. My previous analysis (examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stzcql/google_announces_privacy_changes_to_android_that/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ss5w5r/big_cloud_winner_will_be_based_on_who_can_make/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/)) have been upvoted to the top of /r/stocks or near the top. I noticed that Wallstreet tends to be very late on seeing future trends of chipmakers, which allowed me to make a decent profit. For example, it was only last week when Barclays downgraded AMD on competitive trends. I first warned about this exact same thing, in more detail around a year ago.

I also recommended Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, TSMC, Amazon over AMD. This recommendation has done well as they've collectively been much better than AMD. I believe these companies will continue to beat AMD over the long run. By long run, I mean next 3 years.

Note that I rode AMD from $12 to around $80. Then I switched out to the above companies based on the thesis below. It has done extremely well for me.

**Original post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is\_amd\_the\_king\_of\_the\_titanic\_x86/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is_amd_the_king_of_the_titanic_x86/)

The basic premise was that the computing industry as a whole is moving away from a duopoly (often monopoly) of Intel and AMD. x86 chips (which is what AMD and Intel make) are being replaced at a rapid rate on servers, and Apple Silicon jump-started the switch at the laptop and desktop level.

AMD was fortunate enough to catch Intel's pants down and it was fortunate enough to be making GPUs during the crypto boom.

But when the dust settles, AMD's future looks bleak.

Let's review some of my predictions below with comments in **bold**.

\---------

Most people here focus on AMD vs Intel or AMD vs Nvidia like it's still 2010.

In 2021, it's AMD vs Intel, Nvidia, ARM, Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Ampere, Nuvia.

It's tough to see an exponential trend when you're at the beginning. This post spells out the trends for all AMD markets.

**ARM Attack on consumer x86 market:**

* x86 market shrank by 10% the moment Apple announced a full transition to ARM **True. Apple Silicon is both faster, and far more efficient than AMD's very best chips today. Apple's Macs are growing extremely fast as a result.**
* Even worse, Apple is the forcing function for PC software makers to [support ARM](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/), paving the way for Windows ARM **True. A ton of software makers have developed ARM versions in the last 2 years.**
* Microsoft has just announced [x86 emulation on their Windows ARM OS](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) **Windows 11 ARM can now emulate x86 apps. Paving the way for ARM CPU makers on Windows.**
* Apple's entry-level [M1](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2020) is faster than [4900HS](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-9-4900hs) by 55% in single-core and 3.7% in multi-core while using 5x less power. You can buy an M1 laptop today while the 4900HS is a highly binned-part.
* Apple's entry-level iGPU blows away the very best AMD iGPU
* Apple's ARM chip allows the entry-level Macbook Pro to have 20 hours of battery life while staying extremely cool
* Apple is readying [8,16, 32 core SoCs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs). For reference, M1 has only 4-high performance cores.
* Apple is poised to [significantly increase PC market-share](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/), 100% within 3 years. **On pace.**
* In order to compete, PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP will increasingly look to ARM alternatives
* Microsoft is working on in-house ARM chips for Surface **Yes. They hired Apple ARM architect. They're planning ARM chips for Azure as well.**
* Qualcomm is expected to become [a serious player](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020) in the laptop space **Yes. They bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion to focus on laptops (as the first market).**

**ARM Attack on hyperscalers market:**

* AWS's Graviton2 workload increased by 10x last year. In just one year, Graviton2 is now [10% of all AWS CPU](https://twitter.com/LucidCap/status/1338208878278926338) workloads. **In 2020, Graviton2 accounted for 50% of all new EC2 instances. It's likely much more in 2022. Amazon just announced Graviton3.**
* Like Apple in consumer market, Amazon is the forcing function for better ARM server software support **Yes. Almost all popular server software now have ARM versions.**
* Amazon will most certainly prioritize in-house designs over x86 chips. In the future, Amazon will likely offer x86 only for legacy software. **Looking like it. Look up Graviton3. Amazon is all in.**
* AWS controls 40% of the cloud. If AWS moves most of its future workload to its own CPUs, then AMD can control at best 60% of what Intel used to contol.
* In house ARM chips allow hyperscalers to differentiate, save on cost, and build chips tailored to their unique challenges
* Microsoft is designing its own ARM cloud chips **Yes**
* You can expect Google, Baidu, Tencent to follow soon **Yes. Alibaba, Tencent both launched custom ARM chips for their clouds. Baidu will soon as well. Google has signaled that they will be developing custom ARM chips for their cloud.**
* Hyperscalers don't want to be controlled by a duopoly. If Intel isn't grabbing them by the balls, then it's just AMD. It's the same thing. Hyperscalers want to control their own destiny and ARM allows them to.

**ARM Attack on small size cloud companies:**

* Ampere will allow smaller cloud companies to buy into ARM **If Ampere was a public company, I'd be buying a lot.**
* Anandtech just said that Ampere's latest 80-core chip is [42% better than Epyc](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review/9) in terms of cost/performance
* Ampere is releasing a 128-core chip in 2021
* Anandtech says Ampere's 2022 N1 Neoverse chip could be 50% faster at minimum
* Very well-funded startup Nuvia is also competing here **Bought by Qualcomm to bring ARM to Windows laptops**

**GPUs:**

* Apple will no longer use AMD GPUs in their computers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is testing [64-core and 128-core GPUs](https://videocardz.com/newz/apple-reportedly-developing-high-end-32-core-cpus-and-128-core-gpus). For reference, M1 has 8 GPU cores.
* Nvidia's grip on server GPUs and AI is tight and AMD has a mountain to climb in order to catchup
* With ARM, Nvidia can now offer complete server units from CPU to GPU to interconnects, just like AMD **Although the ARM deal fell through, Nvidia introduced their Grace CPU which they claim is faster than and more efficient than anything AMD offers.**
* Intel is joining the cloud GPU competition, and they're expected to use TSMC to manufacture Xe GPUs. **True**

**Consoles:**

* Mobile gaming is now [3x bigger than consoles](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/)
* Consoles are a low-margin business
* It's quite possible that PS5/Xbox Series X are the last consoles ever if AAA gaming moves to the cloud in the next 6-7 years

**TSMC:**

* As more companies move to in-house designs, competition for TSMC wafers are expected to increase significantly
* Apple is likely to continue to hold a node advantage lead because they have a lot more cash and a lot more volume. Apple's volume will likely increase significantly with Apple Silicon Macs. Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to sell 35 million Macs/year by 2023.
* Unlike Intel, AMD does not have a node advantage over Qualcomm, Ampere, Nuvia, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
* Intel is expected to [make a decision](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4067508) on whether they will invest in their 7nm process node in Spring of 2021 or use TSMC. If Intel decides to go fabless instead, AMD will lose its node advantage over Intel and wafer prices will increase for everyone. **Semi-true.** **Intel will use TSMC 3nm AND continue to develop their 7nm node (renamed to Intel 4). This means Intel will be competing with AMD for TSMC wafers and will continue to build out their own fab.**

**If you're buying into AMD long-term, you have to believe that:**

* AMD will become a monopoly in the x86 market in record time **Not going to happen. Intel's Alder Lake has the performance crown now and better architecture. While Zen4 will be better, Intel is incredibly aggressive with its roadmap.**
* Intel will not switch to TSMC and does not fix its node issues. Basically, you expect Intel to do nothing. **Intel's Alder Lake is a huge return to the performance crown.**
* AMD can make enough progress in Zen to delay the inevitable full ARM dominance
* AMD is working on ARM chips now, or will buy Ampere/Nuvia to enter the ARM race **Nuvia already bought by Qualcomm**
* Wall Street will respond well if AMD decides to go ARM and bet against their own cash cow: Epyc
* AMD can eventually compete with Nvidia in GPUs/AI
* AMD takes a big piece of the cloud gaming pie
* Consoles will have another generation after PS5/Xbox
* Microsoft, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Qualcomm, Nuvia, Nvidia, Intel fail to compete with Zen and Radeon

**My personal recommendation:**

* You can own AMD
* You're crazy if you're still all-in on AMD
* You should diversify your portfolio with TSMC, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia **This suggestion proved to be wise. AMD is getting downgraded while Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia continue to soar. Amazon is doing well. TSMC is ok.**",tv20la,693,292,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tv20la/one_year_ago_i_wrote_a_bear_case_for_amd_lets/

5 trillion of that was added to the Fed’s balance sheet since Feb. 2020: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL

401k balances: https://www.ici.org/401k

——

But oh ya, inflation is only happening because the ships and ports and all that jazz. Definitely not also because of the largest instance of debt monetization in the history of mankind.

This behavior jeopardizes the USD’s status as the reserve currency of the world.


Edit: Not saying that expanding the money supply is the only factor driving inflation. Supply chain issues, as we’ve been experiencing, increases inflation. Supply chain issues + expanding the money supply makes inflation even worse; it exacerbates inflation. I’m also not saying it was a bad thing for the Fed to respond as quickly and vigorously as they did. I do, however, think it was a mistake to add 2 trillion more to their balance sheet from August 2020 until now, amid increasing demand pressures and supply shortages. They kept adding to their balance sheet, expanding the money supply, even as the US made it through the eye of its economic storm.

I also chose 401ks as a reference point to compare against. 9 trillion is hard to conceive of. Thought that a unit of comparison would help. Other comparisons. US GDP = approx. 25 trillion. California GDP = approx. 3.5 trillion. Texas GDP = approx. 2 trillion. NY GDP = approx. 2 trillion. Florida GDP = approx. 1.2 trillion. GDP of UK = 3 trillion. GDP of Germany = 4 trillion.

639,"JPMorgan Profits Drop 42%, Bank Writes off Russian Assets",News,"# Pre-Markets: JPMorgan (JPM) Hits New 52-Week Low!

The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned a profit of $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share, down from a profit of $14.3 billion, or $4.50 a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results missed the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, who were looking for JPMorgan to earn $2.72 a share, according to FactSet.

Much of JPMorgan's profit decline came because, the year before, the bank released more than $4 billion in credit reserves tied to the improving economy and waning COVID-19 pandemic. For more than a year, JPMorgan and other banks had been releasing the funds they had socked away to cover potentially bad loans. Those releases had boosted the bank's profits significantly, but investors knew these one-time bumps in profits were temporary.

Now JPMorgan is going in reverse. The bank set aside $1.46 billion to write off its assets tied to Russia as well as assets that have been negatively exposed to persistently higher inflation. The bank said most of the Russian exposure was in its investment banking division as well as its asset management business.

""We remain optimistic on the economy, at least for the short term – consumer and business balance sheets as well as consumer spending remain at healthy levels – but see significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine,” said JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon in a statement.

JPMorgan is the first of Wall Street big banks to report their results for the first quarter. Analysts expect Wall Street will report a modest, but noticeable, hit to its profits as banks individually report their exposure to Russia. JPMorgan had a modest business in Russia. Citigroup, which had both an investment bank and a consumer banking business, will report its results on Thursday.

The volatility in markets the first three months of the year due to Russia's invasion as well as inflation also negatively impacted the bank's trading desks. JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank posted a 26% decline in profits from a year earlier. Investment banking revenue and fees dropped sharply, as companies put deals on hold. Stock and bond trading revenues also declined.

644,Time to GTFO China? Morningstar and Bill Browder...,,"**EDIT: I'm aware that this is a much discussed topic.  I believe Morningstar's commentary tackles the broader question of not just getting out of China but also dissects the investment sensibility of being involved at all in autocratically-controlled markets.  Thanks to** u/J0eBidensSunglasses **for pointing me to this article.**

From [Morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1083334/autocracy-is-a-bad-investment):

>Sure, investors might make money for a while, but in the end, all that matters are the rules set by the person running the country. And often that means they are setting the rules to maintain power, enrich themselves and their cronies, or both.  
>  
>It was one thing to miss the risks of investing in Russia. It's a country where most diversified investors have only a [small percentage](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1082249) of their portfolio. It's a different story for a country like China. Many mutual funds and stocks have hefty direct or indirect exposure to the country, and observers who had warned about Russia are encouraging investors to ask similar questions about China.

Further, famed fund manager Bill Browder opines:

>Rule of law should be a primary consideration for investors, says Bill Browder, the famed hedge fund manager who made his fortune in Russia, only to be deported after run-ins with oligarchs and whose Russian lawyer was arrested in Moscow, mistreated by authorities, and died in a prison.  
>  
>""You can do all the analysis you want on an industry, on the economics, on the management team, and then all of a sudden somebody comes along and rips you off, and you don't have any recourse in the courts, you don't have recourse in the media … and generally if they're not rule-of-law countries, you have no recourse with the regulators,"" he says. ""It's flying by the seat of your pants, hoping you're in the good graces of whoever is in charge.""

Having come from that side of the world, I've always been wary of markets like China and Russia for exactly the reasons that Morningstar lays out.  When asked, my answer is always the same:  Do you understand the accounting rules of that country?  Do you understand the business dynamics and customs of that country—i.e. if lying and bribery are commonplace, what does that mean for your fundamental analysis?  Still, as Browder points out, you can be an expert on these things and still get whacked by one man who makes decisions not on the basis of what is economically sound, but whatever strokes his own ego.",tk4y60,636,271,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tk4y60/time_to_gtfo_china_morningstar_and_bill_browder/
645,Anybody else feeling suspicious of the last week’s pump ?,Industry Discussion,"Looking at the pump before and after the FOMC meeting over the last week,  it is definitely feeling more like a relief rally to me and less of a rebound as people  are saying.
Dont get me wrong. I am still -$20k down on my portfolio of $100k but here is why i think we can go lower than March 13th low

1) This Setup feels like Late Jan-Early Feb when we hit a bottom right before the Jan FOMC on 27th and then relief rally >6-7% on SPY from 420 to 446 over the early feb period,  then we started crashing again and reached a newer low right before the March 13th FOMC meeting (coincidence again?, I think not)

2) We are gonna see 5 more rate increases this year, and its definitely gonna impact earnings for high growth stocks, since now its more difficult to borrow. In 2018 we had  taper tantrum in Dec , when SPY annual return was like -6% for the year. FAANGs and Banks will continue to make money, but hard to see growth stocks doing the same

3) We still have crazy inflation never seen since the 80s, serious supply chain issues, war in Europe with troop mobilization equivalent to some of the WWII battles, new variant of covid hitting again with china under lockdown and interest rates rising.
Hard to see any positive catalyst in the next 1 year

Thats why I think  volatility and drilling might be back on the table around April- May.. right when earnings start show slower growth before the next FOMC happens. (Remember sell in may and go away?)

What do you think of the behavior of the market in the next few weeks?",ti69ql,639,364,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ti69ql/anybody_else_feeling_suspicious_of_the_last_weeks/

Koch Industries Inc., the energy-based conglomerate whose CEO long opposed environmental regulation and funded groups that questioned climate change, has emerged as one of the biggest financial backers of the battery industry.

A Koch Industries unit has made at least 10 investments worth at least $750 million in the U.S. battery supply chain and electric vehicles in the past 18 months, regulatory filings, news releases and FactSet data show. Koch’s battery investments are among the biggest from outside the auto industry, analysts say.

Founded more than 80 years ago as an oil refiner, Koch Industries is now the most diversified U.S. battery investor, said Vivas Kumar, a former Tesla Inc. senior manager and industry analyst who last year launched a battery-parts startup. “It’s stunning just how many different battery supply chain players they’ve taken a stake in,” he said.

Koch Industries is now a top shareholder in startups such as Freyr Battery SA, FREY 4.41% Aspen Aerogels Inc. ASPN 7.29% and Standard Lithium Ltd. SLI 5.61% The money comes at a crucial time for many of these companies, which need to spend heavily to commercialize their products. Koch appears to be focused on building up the battery industry in the U.S.

Koch Industries operates thousands of miles of pipelines that move oil and gas around the country and several large refineries. The company posts annual sales of about $120 billion through brands such as Brawny paper towels and Dixie cups, fertilizers and fabrics.",tkjdhe,630,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tkjdhe/koch_industries_built_on_oil_bets_big_on_us/

653,Why stocks rise when 10Y treasure hit almost 2.4%,,"The previous weeks, every time the 10Y treasury was making a new high it was major news.

Example from 18th January CNBC

"" 10 year treasury yield hits 2 year high, hovers  around 1.87%""

19th January

""The 10 year U.S. Treasury yield 1.9% on Wednesday its highest point since December 2019"" 

And obviously stock prices were falling those days. The explanation given by the analysts was that since the risk free return increased, investors avoid speculative companies and seek save heavens at bonds etc etc.

Today the treasury hit 2.37% and to my great surprise, there was no article mentioning this huge spike.

And markets keep going up. All unprofitable companies suddenly fly to moon. GME 10% up, Wish 7% up PTON 6% up etc etc

So how about the investors who seek safe assets in a rising interest environment, unprofitable companies that will find it difficult to find  new funding now that bonds are high and all other excuses used to justify why stock prices were free falling when 10Y yield increased from 1.79 to 1.81 back in January?

Can someone help me understand the connection between these two because im really confused.

658,Why are other companies unable or unwilling to improve their trading UIs?,,"So it's certainly not an unpopular opinion to say that Robinhood is a flaming garbage barge of a company, but I know there are many people out there, myself included, that still use it simply because the UI is so seamless and intuitive compared to the major brokerage firms. I have a Fidelity account that I opened early in 2021 with the intention of transferring my portfolio to, but after putting \~20% of my funds in to test it out, I couldn't convince myself to make the switch. Their mobile app and website are clunky and off putting to use and their desktop app, Active Trader Pro, while extremely powerful is archaic, unintuitive, and looks like it was built for windows 95 and hasn't been updated since.

A big part of investing/trading for me is the ability to quickly ascertain information and then execute on it. In Robinhood that is astoundingly easy. Information about your portfolio is immediately present as soon as you open the app, you can check the status of all of your holdings on the same homepage at a glance, watchlists are presented alongside this information in a way that makes sense, and it all just flows. If at any point I want to buy stock, I can tap the ticker and execute an order within 20 seconds.

Fidelity on the other hand (using their \*new and improved\* UI), the homepage also shows you a portfolio line graph, however you can only view performance over the last month or year, no 1 day, 1 week, or 1 quarter options, and for some bizarre reason it measures total change in your account rather than ROC/ROI so any deposit or withdrawal makes this information useless. The price charts for stocks are harder to read and update less frequently (5min rather than every few seconds). Buying stock requires twice as many steps/clicks at a minimum. And viewing options chains and trading options in general is a nightmare.

I am not a web/app developer so I cannot speak to the difficulty of improving these systems, but I can't imagine that with the budget these major financial institutions have they wouldn't be able to create a similar user experience that is offered by Robinhood but with a much better company backing it. And I used Fidelity as my comparison just because that is the only other brokerage account I have actively used, but I have seen the UI of TD Ameritrade and Vanguard and was not impressed with them either.",tnoli6,615,260,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tnoli6/why_are_other_companies_unable_or_unwilling_to/

662,South Park Investment Theory (deeper dive),Discussion,"Ten months ago, u/robertisaak proposed, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naehn4/south_park_investment_theory/) on wsb, using a portfolio derived from South Park episodes. He promised to return with a graph but never did. I took it upon myself to continue his research. 

While the show definitely had its tenbaggers, I assumed that the good calls on Build A Bear Workshop, Tesla ($TSLA), Apple ($AAPL), Sony ($SONY), Amazon ($AMZN) were just lucky, and, all-in-all, the performance should be roughly on par with an index (let's say S&P500, as it uses the same acronym). 

I did however decide to look deeper into it, and to my surprise, a very simple South Park Index^[1] drastically outperforms S&P.

This is how they actually compare:  [2009-2022 graph 🚀🚀🚀](https://i.imgur.com/VhUObvd.jpg). 

A different comparison showing how good our South Park predictions are is the following: consider you buy a stock mentioned in an episode during that day and keep it for a month, respectively a year - how does the performance compare to buying $SPY on that day? Average returns:

* **1 month hold**: South Park Stock: 5.93% 🚀 vs S&P 0.93%
* **1 year hold**: South Park Stock: 35.42% 🚀 vs S&P 11.86%

While past performance doesn't guarantee future performance and this approach has some small biases^[2], the numbers make it quite clear that South Park has been a really good stock selector. But why is that? You could argue that the publicity that it brought helped, but it's definitely too small of an impact for the large-cap stocks (i.e. AAPL, AMZN). Most likely it's just the fact that the episodes tend to focus on things disrupting & impacting our society, those things that change the way we do things ($TSLA, $AAPL, $TWTR), those we love ($SONY) and those we hate ($AMZN). Buying such companies at an early time is a good way to make a strong return (especially in a long Bull Market).

So, should you buy the next stock mentioned? Maybe, probably. 
!!This is not financial advice!!

679,The Big Flip - What the yield curve inversion means for your money,Discussion,"Finally, the yield curve has inverted. It’s something we were all expecting to happen ever since the Fed announced its rate hikes last month. The two-year yield settled in at 2.430% compared to the 2.374% yield of the 10-year U.S Treasury note last Thursday. This is the first time the two-year yield closed above the 10-year yield since 2019. Adding to this, the spread between [5-year and 30-year bonds inverted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-28/treasury-slide-sees-5-30-spread-invert-for-first-time-since-2006) for the first time since 2006! An inverted yield curve is a very prominent indicator for predicting an upcoming recession.

But, before we jump into the implications of the yield curve inversion, it’s important to understand what a yield curve is, how it predicts a recession, and what the previous data tells us.

https://preview.redd.it/bu3pugvy0is81.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e985edd7afffc4cb812239073c08bef5b2bde863

**What is the Yield Curve?**

The yield curve is just a graph showing the relationship between the short-term and long-term interest rates of the U.S Treasury bond. The bond here is the promise between you and the U.S govt that says if you loan some money now (by buying the bond), they will give it back to you later with an added interest.

https://preview.redd.it/jzej4we01is81.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ea73ab9a79b2b59ce278860bfdecae9bf26440

The above chart shows how a normal yield curve would look. The simple logic here is that it’s riskier for you to buy a longer-term bond *(the future is uncertain because of all the unknowns, good and bad, that could happen over years of time)* and you are rewarded proportionally for taking the larger risk. For eg., you would get a significantly lower interest rate if you are investing for 1-year vs 20-year as it’s generally riskier to stash away your money for a longer time period.

https://preview.redd.it/xxjaz9411is81.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69337c54556c499533e7da431ed0ed36b75beb8

But the yield curve is not always positive. If the long-term and the short-term rates get closer together, the yield curve become flat. Finally, if the short-term rates are higher than the long-term rates, the yield curve becomes inverted.

The yield curve becomes inverted when a lot of people are worried about the short-term economy. In theory, you would demand a higher return for taking on a higher risk. So if the yield rate for a short-term bond is higher than a longer-term bond, it implies that investors are so worried about the short-term economic outlook (*i.e they think the present is much riskier than the future*) that they are willing to invest in a longer-term bond at a lower rate.

**Where does the yield curve stand now?**

https://i.redd.it/6buvv2k41is81.gif

This excellent visualization by [Eeagli](https://www.eeagli.com/) shows how the yield curve has changed over the past 6 months. The yield curve hasn’t completely inverted yet, but still, it’s a cause for concern.

https://preview.redd.it/0t4lmyp51is81.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f9521b277b4bf5c4f678f84d7f937fee7dbd8d

The drastic difference that occurred in just the last year in the yield rates is visible in the above chart! Ideally, the yield rates are supposed to be in increasing order like it was in Apr 2021. Now the 2-year yield rate is more than the 10-year one and almost equal to the 30-year yield rate.

**Does Yield Curve Inversion Predict a Recession?**

The yield curve is considered one of the best signals that are currently available for predicting a recession. As per the research done by FRBSF,

>*Every U.S. recession in the past 60 years was preceded by a negative term spread, that is, an inverted yield curve. Furthermore, a negative term spread was always followed by an economic slowdown and, except for one time, by a recession. -* [*FRBSF*](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2018/march/economic-forecasts-with-yield-curve/)

https://preview.redd.it/s7oyvu971is81.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=9479357a888a4ef32f0af4b7586252a4afd8e07f

While the above results are for the spread between 1 and 10-year rates (which is still positive now), research done on 2-year and 10-year spreads shows a similar trend. According to [Commonwealth Financial Network](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/604484/inverted-yield-curve-stocks), the 10-and-2 yield curve has inverted 28 times since 1900, and in 22 of those instances, a recession has followed.

While there is certainly statistical merit for yield curve in predicting a recession, where experts are conflicted is in the type of spread that should be used. There are various different spreads we can consider (3-month vs 10-year, 1-year vs 10-year, 2-year vs 10-year, etc.). All of these provide different probabilities and timelines for an upcoming recession. For example, if you consider the 3-month vs 10-year spread (positive as of now), it has predicted every recession with [100% accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCQwiF0J7hw&ab_channel=CNBC) in the last 50 years.

https://preview.redd.it/6gphtpg81is81.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1e9c6bf2f2fa0e9783a3edae66694b0fd900299

**What’s the best thing to do now?**

Given that, an inverted yield curve is a reliable indicator of a looming economic downturn, what should we do to best prepare our portfolios incase a recession hits. The worst thing you can do now is to panic - especially when the yield curve inverts.

The problem is that even though yield curve inversion indicates a recession, it does so long before the actual recession hits. For eg, the tech bubble burst in Mar’01 but the yield curve had inverted almost 3 years before that (34 months to be exact). The same thing occurred again during the 2008 financial crisis when the yield curve inverted as early as 2005.

According to research conducted by[ LPL Financial,](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/604484/inverted-yield-curve-stocks) Yield curve inversion can be bullish for stocks, and the last four times the 2-and-10 yield curve inverted, the S&P 500 was up an average of 28.8% before it peaked!

Adding to this, I had done an [**extensive analysis**](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/recession-primer?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web) on how the stock market performs during and following a recession.

https://preview.redd.it/g8n1n0ba1is81.png?width=889&format=png&auto=webp&s=239cdedaf68ca0b1d800ed8a2daf127495e06a25

On average, the U.S recessions lasted only 10 months and the market returned a +1.7% in return. What is even more interesting is the market performance just following the recession.

https://preview.redd.it/e4brta3b1is81.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=260627c7eb7e31e4d74fc215e905e4937b9d7c24

After the end of the recession, in just one year, you would have made money in 85% of the cases. And after 3 years, you would have been **in the green in 100% of the cases!**

**Conclusion**

Predicting future economic developments is a tricky business! There are 100’s of factors that are different than the last time, but an inverted yield curve is one of the most reliable predictors we have for accurately predicting a recession.

But as we could see from the analysis, it takes a while for the economy to finally go into recession after the curve has been inverted and you will miss out on the gains till then if you stay out of the market. If you are feeling truly adventurous, you can always try keeping a certain portion of your portfolio out and try to buy the [inevitable dip.](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/is-waiting-for-a-dip-the-best-investment?s=w)

Will it be positive return? Negative return? Neutral?

I can't think of a scenario where tech will NOT outperform the market. Even if interest rates hit 10% and a world war breaks out, I think tech will still be standing tall and strong.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden is preparing to order the release of up to 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve, according to two people familiar with the decision, in a bid to control energy prices that have spiked as the U.S. and allies have imposed steep sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine

The announcement could come as soon as Thursday, when the White House says Biden is planning to deliver remarks on his administration's plans to combat rising gas prices. The duration of the release hasn't been finalized but could last for several months. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the decision.

High oil prices have not coaxed more production, creating a challenge for Biden. The president has seen his popularity sink as inflation reached a 40-year high in February and the cost of petroleum and gasoline climbed after Russia invaded Ukraine. Crude oil on Wednesday traded at nearly $105 a barrel, up from about $60 a year ago.

Still, oil producers have been more focused on meeting the needs of investors, according to a survey released last week by the Dallas Federal Reserve. About 59% of the executives surveyed said investor pressure to preserve ""capital discipline"" amid high prices was the reason they weren't pumping more, while fewer than 10% blamed government regulation.

The steady release from the reserves would be a meaningful sum and come near to closing the domestic production gap relative to February 2020, before the coronavirus caused a steep decline in oil output.

The Biden administration in November announced the release of 50 million barrels from the strategic reserve in coordination with other countries. And after the Ukrainian war began, the U.S. and 30 other countries agreed to an additional release of 60 million barrels from reserves, with half of the total coming from the U.S.

According to the Department of Energy, which manages it, more than 568 million barrels of oil were held in the reserve as of Mar. 25.

News of the administration's planning was first reported by Bloomberg.

Hertz said Polestar cars would be available beginning this spring in Europe and later in 2022 in North America and Australia.

The Florida-based rental car company said that it would initially order the Polestar 2 sedan. Hertz shares were up 1.75% in premarket trading Monday.

Hertz in October announced its order to purchase 100,000 electric cars from Tesla Inc, primarily the EV maker's Model 3.

In March, Hertz added Tesla's mid-size SUV Model Y to its electric vehicle fleet, according to the car rental firm's website.

Polestar, which was founded by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, is set to merge with special purpose acquisition company: Gores Guggenheim Inc, this year.

The Hertz partnership ""will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements,"" Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement.

721,8 Reasons To Never Bet Against the US,Advice,"#Intro

I’m going to outline 8 reasons why I believe the US remains the best place in the world to invest. This will cover culture, future projections, economic sectors, and international relations. This is going to try to remain as factual as possible with all information sited. Each of these bullet points is going to be generally stating why the US markets have an advantage over other developed markets like Europe and Japan or an advantage over developing markets such as China and India. [This is the theory behind the strategy that I run]( https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialAnalysis/comments/ry1qq5/efficient_leveraged_portfolios/) and suggest to people to best take advantage of this market.

###More Investors
 * In the United States if you want to retire well off you need to be invested in all non-outlier cases. Some people chose real estate, but stocks are far more popular. About [5 percent of people own a second property]( https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/10/nations-stock-of-second-homes-2/) which I’m using as a rough proxy for how many people would be considered real estate investors. The point is that it’s a very low number. To contrast this between [52]( https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/25/more-than-half-of-u-s-households-have-some-investment-in-the-stock-market/) and [56]( https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx) percent of people are invested in the stock market. Social security exists as a safety net, but it will barely keep you out of poverty. In the 1980’s [60% of workers had a defined benefit pension. This is down to just 4% now.]( https://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/pensions_basics.moneymag/index7.htm) This means that if a majority of people currently working want to retire comfortably, they need the market to do well. This is a bullish sign for the market for two main reasons. The first is that most of these people are adding a portion of their paycheck to various index funds every other week. These massive monetary inflows create a permanent upward pressure on the market. The second reason is less direct, but due to the scale of the incentive for the market to do well, laws, regulations, and interest rates are all going to be biased in favor of the market. This explains a reason why the US market should trend up, but why should it trend up faster than other markets? The answer is that the percentage of people who invest in other countries is far smaller. [15% of people in Germany, 17% of people in the Netherlands, 33% of people in the UK]( https://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/pensions_basics.moneymag/index7.htm), and [only 7% of people in China]( https://www.thebalance.com/china-stock-market-shanghai-shenzhen-hong-kong-3305480#:~:text=Only%207%20percent%20of%20China's,swings%20in%20China's%20stock%20market.&text=In%20China%2C%20less%20than%2020,is%20in%20the%20stock%20market.) hold stocks. This means the inflows to their markets are smaller and the incentive to favor the market in their national policies is weaker. This is only one of many factors that influence market movements.

###High Consumer Spending
 * In the United States people are incredibly fond of spending. It’s quite straightforward that a lot of spending means a lot of money flowing into businesses. These elevated cashflows directly lead to increased stock prices. Now of course not all companies only do business in their home country, but that’s where most of their revenue typically comes from. The way I decided to compare this with other countries spending is by looking at [household consumption as a percent of GDP]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/consumption_GDP/#:~:text=Household%20consumption%20is%20about%2060,over%2080%20percent%20of%20GDP.). The US is not at the top of the list, but it is significantly higher than most of its wealthy peers. 68% of US GDP comes from household consumption compared to 52% in Japan or 51% in the EU. You can also see the [sheer scale of US consumer spending when it’s displayed nominally]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/household_consumption_dollars/). The people of the US spend 7x as much as the people of Germany, even though the US only has a bit over 3x the people. 

###Low (Enough) Corruption
 * Despite all of the issues you see on the news about the US government and its politicians, it’s a relatively uncorrupted country. [While it scores far from the top on the control of corruption index]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_corruption/) the idea is that it’s more than good enough to invest in. The main point is that it ranks far above most major developing countries that could in theory outgrow the US markets in the next couple decades such as Brazil, India, and China. Despite these countries generally having higher annual GDP growth, their uncertainty and inconsistency when it comes to investing scares away a lot of potential money. This gives the US markets an advantage over most developing markets but doesn’t provide any advantage over Europe for this point. 

###Past Performance Indicates Future Performance
 * Everyone has heard that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, but guarantee is the problem word there. Nothing in the market is guaranteed, but the past is still a fantastic indictor of what we can expect in the future, broadly speaking. US markets have grown at an average rate of 5-10% annually for many decades depending on what time frame you look at. This is not as true for other developed economies. Over the past 25 years the US [has returned 50% more on average annually]( http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/comparison/european-stocks-vs-us-stocks/) than a comparable portfolio of European stocks. The time frame is somewhat restrained by the data available in some emerging countries such as Brazil and India who both only got stable exchanges in the 1990’s. This is still far enough back to cover multiple business cycles and generally give an idea of expected returns. Over the same time frame [emerging markets returned a very similar amount]( http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/allocation/emerging-markets/) to their European counterparts. Of course the future could be very different, but past performance suggests that the US has the right combination of traits to be the most successful market and most of those traits likely remain. 

###Continued Population Growth
 * One of the biggest long run concerns of investors is that population growth is stagnating or even dropping in the most developed countries. The last hundred years of growth have been greatly assisted by an ever increasing population. Japan’s stock market is famously very flat. It remains [below it’s high that was achieved in the 1990s]( https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/stock-market). There are a variety of reasons for this but one of the major concerns with the country is that there population has appeared to peak and has been slowly trending down since 2010. Estimates project that they will fall from 126 million to 75 million by 2100. [The EU faces a similar issue]( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20190710-1). They are projected to fall from 450 million to 416 million by 2100. This is where the US completely stands out from the rest of the developed world. The US is [projected to increase in population from 330 million to 430 million]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth) in this same time frame. This growth rate is on par with many developing countries and far ahead of ones like China and Brazil who are expected to shrink. I can’t state strongly enough how much of a comparative boost this will provide the US. I also want to point out that most of this growth is expected to come from immigration as our birth rates aren’t that much different than Europe. 

###Global Reserve Currency
 * The USD is what is known as the global reserve currency. Central banks around the world hold significant amounts of foreign currency for a variety of reasons. These include the ability to stabilize your own currency against another, facilitate international trade, and to provide protection in case of market shocks. It makes sense that other countries would hold something they think is stable, useful, and commonly accepted. The USD is this currency more often than not making up [59% of all foreign reserves]( https://blogs.imf.org/2021/05/05/us-dollar-share-of-global-foreign-exchange-reserves-drops-to-25-year-low/). It cannot be understated how powerful of an economic tool this is. We have just seen this in action when sanctions were placed on Russia. The US government [has frozen more than half a trillion in Russian reserves]( https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/us/politics/us-sanctions-russia-central-bank.html). Another example of this being used was in 2020 when the US created trillions of new dollars. This increase in money supply was not only born by US citizens. It was absorbed globally due to the extensive currency reserves. Why does this give US markets an advantage? It provides the country as a whole with a powerful weapon that can be used to push the world into a more favorable position. It means the US can use QE to escape recession more effective than any other country, on paper at least. Lastly, it makes foreign trade incredibly easy. All of these are pieces that provide better economic conditions than their competitors can create. 

###Military Dominance
 * It’s no secret that the US spends a lot on its military. The scale is sometimes lost on people though because there’s a huge difference between being the biggest, and [being larger than the next nine combined]( https://www.visualcapitalist.com/u-s-military-spending-vs-other-top-countries/). This military dominance is tremendously beneficial to the overall health of the economy for a couple of reasons. The first is that it provides an incredibly safe place to do business. People are hesitant about doing business in a country that has even a tiny threat of being invaded. An example that’s frequently talked about on Reddit is the possible risk of investing in Taiwan due to its proximity and scale compared to China. The US has both an ocean and the worlds largest military separating it from any hostile powers. Notice how even though Germany wasn’t attacked by Russia last month, there was still [substantial fear]( https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/stock-market) in their financial markets, though a large portion of this was related to energy fears - another issue the US outperforms in. People might mention that nuclear weapons could reach the US from just about anywhere, but I consider that a non-point. The minute nukes start flying the minute your money doesn’t mean anything anymore. There’s also an economic side to the military that can be broken into two parts. The first is that that 800 billion dollar budget needs to be spent somewhere and that somewhere is in the US economy. In the latest budget [a staggering 130 billion is allocated to research and development]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/white-house-to-seek-813-3-billion-national-security-budget), as an example. A secondary economic factor is that this military power allows the US to provide the same protection it provides itself to its allies. Groups like NATO have a “common defense clause” that basically say if you attack any member you have attacked all of the members. So even though a country like Iceland [doesn’t have a military]( https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_162083.htm#:~:text=Iceland%20is%20the%20only%20Ally,the%20Alliance%20until%20the%201990s.) it is still quite safe from invasion because no one wants to go to war with the rest of the pact. Having these safe allies provides both a great place to do business, which leads to economics and trade growth. 

###Key Industry Dominance
 * Lastly, the US has economic dominance in two of the world’s most crucial industries, energy and technology. The US [is the world’s largest oil producer]( https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=709&t=6) which drastically reduces their reliance on hostile foreign governments. This doesn’t mean that the country is immune to changes in the global price of oil, but it does offer comparative lower prices [than most of their developed competitors]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/gasoline_prices/). It also provides some security if the world enters into a depression or becomes more fractured. On a more abstract note, the US is also the [global leader in technological development]( https://info.kpmg.us/news-perspectives/technology-innovation/us-extends-tech-innovation-leadership.html#:~:text=China%20is%20close%20behind%20but,Silicon%20Valley%20are%20rising%20fast.&text=More%20than%20a%20third%20of,2018%20global%20technology%20innovation%20survey.). Technology is the backbone of the economy and being one step ahead of the rest of the world is an incredible advantage. A huge number of the worlds most advanced projects and highest potential innovations are being done by US based tech companies and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. While China is ranked #2 and gaining ground, this is not as significant as it may seem. China is not investor friendly and is unlikely to change that. Investor money is still going to flow to the US for the foreseeable future. 

#Conclusion

This has been a **BULL** case for the united states. There are currently no intentions to write a bear case as most of the points are simply going to be the inverse of the ones stated here. The goal of this post is to highlight why I believe the US, despite the last decade of massive growth, is still the worlds best place to invest and will remain so for the foreseeable future. If you want to refute one of the points please, I beg you, back up what you say with reputable sources. One thing I want to note is that just because a company is US based, that doesn’t mean those companies have a strictly US based revenue stream. Most of the massive companies that drive the market’s growth are international. If the US goes into a deep recession, most of the world will also likely go into a deep recession. There are benefits to diversification but adding more to a portfolio does not always make it better!

#TLDR
The US’s excess growth compared to other developed countries is not an anomaly. The US is highly unlikely to follow in the footsteps of countries like Japan. There are numerous factors that drove our growth that still exist and will continue to exist for the foreseeable future.",toarrz,534,588,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/toarrz/8_reasons_to_never_bet_against_the_us/

724,What is ONE idea or mindset you hold onto with dear life when making investment decisions? Here is mine:,,"As a disclaimer, I am not trying to ''educate'' anyone or act like I know it all. I am far from an expert, and I will never consider myself as such out of respect for the complexity of stock-picking, but after reading the major works of Howard Marks, Graham, Buffet, Munger, and having observed my own behavior and others around me during good and bad times, my major approach sums up to the following sentence:

""You're neither right nor wrong because people agree with you or disagree with you. In other words, being contrarian has no special virtue over being a trend follower. You’re right because your facts and reasoning are right.""

(Not sure if Buffet or Graham said it, but anyways)

It might seem like an obvious statement, but in my experience it's far from it...

I think there is a reason why Munger states knowledge in psychology and human nature is of immense importance when it comes to investment decisions, likewise, I also understand now why they are so critical of some business schools and their way of approaching the market; as if it was a robotic machine with predictable outcomes with no interference of human emotions.

I read news a lot and like to I listen to people, and I have noticed that when times are good, people will always rationalize over why a stock will continue increasing. Not too long ago, if we take Meta as an example, you wouldn't hear too many bad things being said about it. A safe blue chip stock, has monopolized all social media, and what not... But now that it has taken a major nose-dive (in stock price, very unproportional to corresponding loss of the company itself) you will hear everywhere, from analysts, people, news outlets that it's ''over'', the future looks ''hazy'', ''TkTok is rising'', ''Metaverse won't work out'' Whatever... I am not into that stuff, they might be right, and they might be wrong. I don't know. But the point is, if people truly had the conviction they had previous to the nose-dive, now would be the perfect time to invest a huge chunk in such a company. But most don't, this just proves it was all a bluff. They never truly believed in it, it was all emotions. Once again, psychology... Human emotions... Just like when times are good, they only saw the strengths of the company and no weaknesses, now that times are bad, they can only see the weakness of the company and no strengths, and they can only come up with reasons why it might go to shit.

Same thing with Tesla right now, I look around me and the majority can only see what's fantastic about the company. They have the best production rate, the best factories, the best batteries, the best engineers, branding power, whatever... I don't even know whether it's true, I'm not into this sector, this is just what I hear all the time around me. How would the opinions of majority of these people change if say Tesla nose-drived like Meta or Alibaba did right now? Say 50-60% because of just one missed quarter? I am willing to bet people will start saying ''the automobile industry is tough'', ''VW's catching up, their engineers are better...''.

Now those are just generalized examples to get my point across, but bottom line is, behavior like this is not surprising to me anymore, and there is a reason only a selected few will achieve desirable outcomes long-term, because as the quote in the beginning states, it's not about being a contrarian for the sake of being contrarian, or just following the flow. It's about making rational decisions and having this ''temperament'' that is often talked about, so that you're not dragged down by the panic and mania around you.",u0fw0u,525,319,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u0fw0u/what_is_one_idea_or_mindset_you_hold_onto_with/

The government should “actively introduce policies that benefit markets,” according to a meeting of **China’s top financial policy committee led by Vice Premier Liu He**, the country’s top economic official. That vow to take investors interests into account comes after a sell-off in domestic shares due to fears over growth risks and tough regulation of real estate and internet companies.

The meeting offered investors re-assurance that a sweeping crackdown on internet companies was nearing its end and that the government would prevent a disorderly collapse in the property market. China’s banking regulator said after the meeting that it would support insurance companies to increase investment in stock markets.

Stocks surged after the announcements. **The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped 13% at the close in Hong Kong, the most since 2008**, recouping nearly half of this year’s losses.

749,"Justice Department backs antitrust bill targeting Apple, Amazon, Google",Resources,"The Justice Department Monday endorsed legislation forbidding large digital platforms such as Amazon and Google from favoring their own products and services over competitors’, marking the Biden administration’s first full-throated support of the antitrust measure.

“The Department views the rise of dominant platforms as presenting a threat to open markets and competition, with risks for consumers, businesses, innovation, resiliency, global competitiveness, and our democracy,” says a letter to bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, signed by Peter Hyun, the Justice Department’s acting assistant attorney general for legislative affairs.

The letter, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, expresses support for the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which the Senate’s judiciary panel approved in January in a bipartisan vote, as well as similar legislation moving through the House.

AAPL, +0.50% and others oppose the proposed legislation, saying it would make it harder to offer popular services. The bills’ opponents also say it is fair for e-marketplaces, search engines and app stores to profit off their creations’ popularity.

The department’s letter throws its weight behind a different view: that the platforms’ dominant position gives them unchecked power to influence the fate of other businesses, and that restricting the platforms’ conduct would carry significant benefits. 

“Discriminatory conduct by dominant platforms can sap the rewards from other innovators and entrepreneurs, reducing the incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation,” the letter says.

765,Worried about recession? Data suggests U.S. stocks could rise 24%,Opinion,"According to CNBC, more than 80% of American adults are worried about a recession recently. Luke Lango, senior investment analyst at InvestorPlace, said that everyone seems to be worried about a U.S. recession and a stock market crash, but the reality is that recession and stock market crashes don't happen when everyone expects them.

According to behavioral economics theory, because the fear of a recession is so high, we are all but guaranteed not to fall into one, Lango said. Not just theory, history and data support this claim. Therefore, we are very optimistic that there may be a ""melt rise"" of up to 24% in the US stock market in the next 12 months.

(Note: A “melt rally” refers to a sustained and often unexpected improvement in the investment performance of an asset or asset class, in part because investors don’t want to miss out on its rally, rather than improving economic fundamentals.)

Lango further explained the ""behavioral economics theory"" mentioned: When people expect a recession, everyone acts with fear and caution. This wariness keeps us from getting too close to the brink of crisis. But when no one was expecting a recession, people were carefree. And lack of caution and fear can send us ""falling off a cliff.""

That's why they became optimistic after seeing a CNBC report that more than 80 percent of U.S. adults are worried about a recession.

**First, the U.S. recession followed extreme excitement, not extreme fear**

Lango combed through the months leading up to previous U.S. stock market routes and found that recessions and U.S. stock routs always followed peaks of euphoria, not fear.

Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020: The last slump in U.S. stocks occurred in March 2020. What were people thinking in January and February before this? They are optimistic; in February 2020, the consumer sentiment reading, or consumer confidence index, hit 101—the highest level in years. Google searches for the term ""recession"" hit a multi-year low in the previous month.

Financial Crisis of 2008 (beginning in late 2007): In early to mid-2007, we again saw consumers generally optimistic and not worried about a recession. The Consumer Confidence Index remained above 80 - a very stable reading. It wasn't until the end of the year that consumers started Googling the word ""recession.""

The dot-com bubble of 2000: Before this bubble, consumers were very optimistic; for most of 1999 and 2000, the consumer confidence index was regularly above 100. In fact, this is one of the most optimistic times ever for American consumers.

1990 U.S. Recession: Consumers were also very optimistic and unconcerned prior to the recession; during 1989 and 1990, the Consumer Confidence Index was frequently above 90.

**Second, the data suggest that the U.S. stock market may have a melt-up of as much as 24% in the next 12 months**

Lango said the U.S. economy is going through a very unusual (and pessimistic on the surface) period right now. Basically, American consumers have never been more afraid.

The consumer confidence index has fallen sharply over the past year, with a reading of 59.4 as of March 31, the lowest reading since 2011. Meanwhile, a Google search for ""recession"" is surging to the highest level since the stock market slump due to the coronavirus pandemic.

According to statistics, in the past, market confidence dropped sharply to an ultra-low level of 60 or below only 5 times: in mid-2011, at the end of 2008, at the end of 1990, at the beginning of 1980 and at the end of 1974. Every big drop in consumer confidence has followed a slump in U.S. stocks.

Lango believes they usually mark the bottom of a big sell-off. Historically, a sharp decline in U.S. consumer confidence has been a promising contrarian buying indicator. They always precede a sharp rally in the stock market, not a slump. We don't think this time will be any different.

In four of the five scenarios mentioned above, U.S. stocks rebounded in the following three months. On each of these five occasions, stocks rallied higher over the next 12 months. The data showed that the average gain of the stock market in the three months after the sharp decline in consumer confidence was nearly 7%; the average gain of the stock market in the next 12 months was nearly 24%.

**Third, fears of a U.S. recession will “protect” the market**

Lango believes that the latest plunge in consumer confidence suggests the market is very cautious. Markets are poised to surge higher on any good news - perhaps the Fed may turn dovish before the summer, or a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, or a drop in oil and commodities, etc. Any of the above could happen in the coming months. If so, the current stock market sell-off could quickly turn into a 20%-plus melt-up.",tzeqkx,473,185,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tzeqkx/worried_about_recession_data_suggests_us_stocks/

767,"USD Inflation surges to 8.5% on an annual basis, highest since 1981 (according to newly released CPI Report)",Discussion,">The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.2 percent in March on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.8 percent in February, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.5 percent before seasonal adjustment.  
>  
>Increases in the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food were the largest contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The gasoline index rose 18.3 percent in March and accounted for over half of the all items monthly increase; other energy component indexes also increased. The food index rose 1.0 percent and the food at home index rose 1.5 percent.  
>  
>The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3 percent in March following a 0.5-percent increase the prior month.

In contrast, the index for used cars and trucks fell 3.8 percent over the month.

Okay retarded retards, I have found the ultimate gamma squeeze play. I was working yesterday and saw a post about $EVTL after I finished working at 5PM. I saw that shit and realized that it was *the perfect setup for a gamma squeeze.* Then I thought to myself, there has to be more plays like this? **I bring to you $ARQQ. Heavily inspired by** [u/epicolvier3](https://www.reddit.com/u/epicolvier3/) **and his $EVTL play.**

$ARQQ otherwise known as Arqit Quantum Inc is a software company that supplies a unique *quantum* encryption Platform-as-a-Service which... **syke nobody gives a shit about what it does.** Let me just get straight into the details:

*I took it upon myself to build a scanner to find the exact same type of play. Went on ThinkorSwim and added a couple filters and found* ***ONLY ONE TICKER*** *(at least with the existing options as of today, can change in the future,* **I will post more in the future...***) which is $ARQQ.*

**MASSIVE OI**[https://imgur.com/YiVF8YP](https://imgur.com/YiVF8YP)

On the April 14th 2022 15C ([ARQQ220414C00015000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARQQ220414C00015000?p=ARQQ220414C00015000)) there is over 6000 open interest. Just like $EVTL, the open interest is INSANE. Thats 600,000 shares!!!! If we close above 15$ (which is a joke, keep reading, were already at \~13.5$), there will be 600,000 shares in the money. Market makers will need to purchase all that! This shit expires in 2 days and I am 99.69% certain of a gamma squeeze. Every time you retards buy a call contract MMs will need to hedge to stay delta neutral and buy 100 shares for every contract so the play here is to buy both shares and options. Both of these will drive the price up causing the inevitable gamma squeeze.

**TRADING VOLUME IS LOW AS HELL**[https://imgur.com/a/lyryA4A](https://imgur.com/a/lyryA4A)

The volume on this yesterday was 161k shares (at a price of 13$ each). That is absolutely peanuts. Why is that important? Literally any buying pressure will make the stock skyrocket. Why do you think you retards arent allowed to trade after hours? Because when the volume is low the price is subject to volatility and you will go cry to your mamma after. In this case, it is in OUR FAVOR because this shit is gonna sky rocket during market hours.

Let me convince you some more. WSB made EVTL get a volume of 18million. Up from 40k (lmfao) from the previous day. A volume of even 1/3rd of this amount will send the calls far far far ITM. Thats 6000+ OI ITM in 2 freaking days. The gamma squeeze will be *huge*. ***ARQQ never even saw more than 3-5million in volume and that was at ATH. This could potentially blow past ATHs of 40$.*** *Yeah, I know...* Also, we don't have shares locked up here, but it doesn't freaking matter, the truth is its the volume that is important. If the volume is low, then the order book is thin, which means price will go up very quickly.

IV is still relatively low so the options are priced in very cheap. **MMs won't know whats about to hit them. If they knew, the IV would be much higher, trust me. ;)** MMs will lose, retail will prevail.

**Positions: 1420 ARQQ & 142 4/14 15CPositions: 1420 ARQQ & 142 4/14 15CPositions: 1420 ARQQ & 142 4/14 15C**

There were people saying on EVTL that going further in the money was risky, but let's be honest even the 10calls were ITM. Many of the options did an easy 10x-22x. Insane. And imagine when we get the gamma squeeze. Right now the options are cheap as hell, you can probably throw in a couple hundred dollars but it will end up hurting the MMs much more since they priced them so low. If you want to be safe, you can buy further out in time or just buy shares, but personally, I think the 4/14 15C will have the most liquidity and increase the most (I am estimating anywhere between 10x-20x from open) .

Also, I don't suggest you guys buy puts on this, IV will eat you alive. Either hop on, or move on. Or you can hate like [u/ComputerTE1](https://www.reddit.com/u/ComputerTE1/) and miss out like he does every single time. Remember, if he comments , it is bullish!

THIS IS A GAMMA SQUEEZE, *not* a short squeeze.

**CHART SETUP**

Chart setup is also very beautiful. We are at the yearly support at around \~12.6$ so we aren't buying near resistance or high prices. Buy low sell high. Average buy price on this is 22.15$. Most people are already underwater, I don't expect any selling pressure at all. Could even be an interesting swing play. Forgetting the whole gamma squeeze, this seems like a nice buying opportunity at support, as a pure technical analysis type play.[https://imgur.com/a/MySn72O](https://imgur.com/a/MySn72O)

\---------------

**TLDR: BUY $ARQQ 4/14 15C or shares, get gamma squeeze, get lambo.TLDR: BUY $ARQQ 4/14 15C or shares, get gamma squeeze, get lambo.TLDR: BUY $ARQQ 4/14 15C or shares, get gamma squeeze, get lambo.**

MASSIVE OI on 4/14 15C + LOW VOLUME + good price entry point regardless = recipe for lambo

We already have a mutual fund for each kid that we plan to give them control of after college to help them start out/or get a head start on retirement but I want this to be separate of that.

Apr 4, 2022 7:30 AM EDT

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon's total compensation rose to $84.4 million for 2021, up from $31.7 million in 2020, according to the bank's annual proxy statement filed Monday. The figure includes $52.6 million in option awards for 2021, up from no option awards in 2020. ""The special award granted to Mr. Dimon reflects the board's desire for him to continue to lead the firm for a further significant number of years,"" the company said. ""The board also took into account other factors, including the firm's strong performance under Mr. Dimon's stewardship since 2005, his exemplary leadership, and his significant contributions to the firm's success during his tenure."" Dimon's total annual compensation in 2021 rose to $34.5 million from $31.5 million in 2020 and 2019. The increase was due to a $3 million boost he received in performance share units (PSUs) to $28 million in 2021 from $25 million. His salary remained at $1.5 million. Shares of JP Morgan Chase are down 14.6% so far in 2022, compared to a drop of 4.6% by the S&P 500 and a loss of 4.2% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/4/1/amazon-union-maintains-commanding-lead-in-new-york-election

Mainstream Media take is that it’s a big win for “the people” and a knock on “evil big tech”. 

My expectation is that Amazon will maintain a zero tolerance policy on unions and basically “deprecate” (to use a software term) warehouses that do unionize. In other words, they will either freeze future investment and growth in any warehouses that unionize or straight up shut them down. I think the news is net negative for Amazon stock, but won’t have as big of an effect as the media would like to tell it. Maybe $100M/year costs and losses for unionization, loss of warehouses, loss of productivity, and expenses to counteract unionization. I would also expect a much larger impact on costs that is harder to measure - upward pressure on compensation and benefits to lessen the appeal of unions. Upward pressure on compensation and benefits would also decrease employee acquisition costs, improve retention, and improve morale / productivity so the net effect is hard to guess.

I’m not a labor or Amazon expert so curious to hear other thoughts on the impact on the company and stock. Please no political opinions or opinions on unions themselves.

[Advanced Micro Devices ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/amd)reached a deal to acquire cloud-services provider Pensando Systems for $1.9 billion in a bid to continue expanding its data center capabilities.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (ticker: [AMD ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/amd)) were up 0.5% to $107.63 in trading Monday. Pensando isn’t publicly traded.

AMD will pay approximately $1.9 billion before working capital and other adjustments, the company said Monday.

Pensando’s distributed services platform is already deployed at scale across cloud and enterprise customers, including [Goldman Sachs ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/gs), IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud. The platform includes a programmable packet processor that can accelerate networking, security, storage, and other services for cloud and enterprise applications, the companies said.

“In less than five years Pensando has assembled a best-in-class engineering team that are experts in building systems together with a rich, deep ecosystem of partners and customers who have currently deployed over 100,000 Pensando platforms into production,” said Pensando CEO Prem Jain. “Joining together with AMD will help accelerate growth in our core business and enable us to pursue a much larger customer base across more markets.”

The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022. Upon closing, Jain will join AMD as part of the Data Center Solutions Group.",tw8tjw,419,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tw8tjw/amd_to_buy_cloudservices_provider_pensando_for_19/

817,Judgment day tomorrow with Powell speaking.. What are your predictions for tomorrow?,Industry Discussion,"So we are finally one night away from the first of many rate hikes of 2022.. 
At this point market has priced in 25 basis points, however anything more than that would mean Fed and Powell is panicking about sky high inflation of 7.9% and may send the markets crashing.

Additionally, even if the hike is only 25 basis points, its the guidance that will matter the most and if Powell says they are anticipating >5 hikes of 25 basis points this year,  we can expect the market to could go to a tailspin and have same kind of volatility like 2018 all over again and could reach the Jan-Feb 2020 highs for SPY and Dow

Add to that 40 year high inflation of 7.9%, supply chain issues, commodity prices rising and first large war in Europe since WWII. 

Tomorrow could be a very volatile day and Powell has to walk a very fine line.. 
I wonder what  Powell is thinking right now

818,St. Louis Fed’s Bullard says the central bank should raise rates above 3% this year,,"St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday he thinks the central bank should raise interest rates the equivalent of 12 times this year to convince the public it is serious about fighting inflation. As the lone dissenter at this week’s Federal Reserve meeting, Bullard said in a statement that he would like to see the central bank’s benchmark interest rate boosted above 3% from the near-0% level where it had stood. “This would quickly adjust the policy rate to a more appropriate level for the current circumstances,” he said. Following its two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday said it would raise overnight rates for banks by 0.25 percentage point, historically the typical increment with which the FOMC moves. Accompanying economic projections indicated a path this year that would see the equivalent of seven rate hikes, or 1.75 percentage points. The move was the first time the Fed has raised the rate since December 2018 and came in response to a stunning increase in inflation that has seen prices rise at their fastest pace in 40 years.

Bullard was the only FOMC member to vote against the move, stating he would have preferred a rate hike of 0.5 percentage point, or 50 basis points. He added the Fed also should have started the process of reducing the nearly $9 trillion in bond holdings it has accumulated over the past 14 years. In his statement Friday, Bullard said inflation is hurting people the Fed is trying to help the most, namely those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. “The burden of excessive inflation is particularly heavy for people with modest incomes and wealth and for those with limited ability to adjust to a rising cost of living,” he said. “The combination of strong real economic performance and unexpectedly high inflation means that the Committee’s policy rate is currently far too low to prudently manage the U.S. macroeconomic situation.”

Fed officials overall were divided on how to proceed with rates this year. Ten members penciled in a fed funds rate of 1.75%-2% by year’s end, but eight said it should be higher. The highest “dot” on the committee’s dot plot, presumably Bullard’s, indicated a range of 3%-3.25%. He pointed out that the Fed has moved that aggressively before, in 1994-95 to combat a revving economy and a gradual rise in inflation. “The results were excellent,” Bullard said. “The Committee achieved 2% inflation on average and the U.S. economy boomed during the second half of the 1990s. I think the Committee should try to achieve a similar outcome in the current environment.” On the issue of the Fed’s balance sheet, Bullard did not provide details of what he thinks the central bank should do, saying only that “a plan” at this week’s meeting would have been appropriate. The post-meeting statement indicated that the committee “expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting.” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said afterward that the process could begin as soon as May.

856,"Information About Sales of Big Blocks of Stock Routinely Leaks to Select Investors Ahead of Time, per WSJ",News,"[Big Stock Sales Are Supposed to Be Secret. The Numbers Indicate They Aren’t. - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-stock-sales-are-supposed-to-be-secret-the-numbers-indicate-they-arent-11648647914?mod=hp_lead_pos2)

For years, something strange kept happening on Wall Street.

Before a big shareholder could carry out plans to sell a slug of stock, the price dropped. It was as if other investors knew what was coming.

It happened when Bain Capital sold shares of [Canada Goose Holdings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOOS) Inc., the maker of trendy parkas; when 3G Capital sold stock in [Kraft Heinz](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KHC) Co. ; when [Apollo Global Management](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/APO) Inc. sold shares of [Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NCLH) Ltd. ; and when Alaska’s state oil fund trimmed its stake in an artificial-intelligence software firm.

These transactions, known as block trades, are supposed to be a secret between the selling shareholders and the investment banks they hire to execute the trades. But a Wall Street Journal analysis of nearly 400 such trades over three years indicates that information about the sales routinely leaks out ahead of time—a potentially illegal practice that costs those sellers millions of dollars and benefits banks and their hedge-fund clients.

[The Journal’s analysis](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-we-analyzed-wall-street-block-trades-11648647951?mod=article_inline), covering 393 block trades between 2018 and 2021, found that 58% of the time, the share price declined in the trading session immediately beforehand, controlling for the performance of peer companies. Of the 268 trades for which the Journal was able to determine how much the banks paid, the sellers would have received $382 million more if the stocks had performed in line with the benchmark, or about $1.4 million per trade.

A handful might be explained by a negative headline or chalked up to bad luck. But the persistent pattern of stocks falling in the run-up to big insider sales suggests a more widespread problem: Information that should be confidential is getting out.

That pattern is now at the heart of a federal investigation into whether banks tip off favored clients to coming block trades. The Securities and Exchange Commission has sought trading records and electronic communications from a number of big banks and hedge funds, and the U.S. Justice Department is running its own probe, [the Journal first reported in February](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-probe-block-trading-at-morgan-stanley-goldman-other-wall-street-firms-11644875448?mod=article_inline).

The investigation for now appears to be focused on [Morgan Stanley](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MS), [MS **-1.44%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MS?mod=chiclets)the dominant bank in block trading in recent years. The firm disclosed later in February that it had been responding to information requests from the Justice Department since the summer. In November, it put one of its senior executives in charge of block trading, Pawan Passi, on leave. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Passi’s behalf and repeated attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful.

[Goldman Sachs Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GS) Inc. has also received requests from regulators, the Journal reported.

The investigation, along with a broader market decline, has chilled the big business of block trading in recent months, bankers and investors said.

The Journal’s analysis found that when Morgan Stanley executed a block trade by itself, the median stock trailed its peers by 0.7 percentage point in the trading session leading up to the deal, meaning half performed worse than that. That was the worst record of any of the biggest banks that are major players in block trading. The median of [Credit Suisse Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CS) AG’s deals was underperformance of 0.4 percentage point, the analysis found. The median trades executed by Goldman and [Barclays](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BCS) PLC roughly matched the market.

Across all banks, the median stock lagged by 0.2 percentage point.

Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Goldman and Barclays declined to comment. The other companies and investors mentioned in this article either declined to comment or didn’t respond.

Leaks could come from a number of sources. Companies tend to approach multiple banks to bid on block deals, leaving open the possibility that someone other than the winner of the business has leaked the information.

There isn’t a comprehensive public list of block trades. Some are registered with the SEC. Others can be gleaned from more obscure corporate filings. Many leave no trace at all. The Journal’s analysis drew from databases maintained by research firms IPO Boutique and Dealogic as well as information from market participants, and matched details of those trades to securities filings where possible, but the list likely isn’t exhaustive.

Insiders who want to sell a slug of stock have a problem: Posting the order to a public exchange would likely tank the price. So they turn to Wall Street.

An investment bank agrees, generally around midday, to quietly buy the shares at a discount to the market’s closing price later that day. The bank then aims to flip the stock to its trading clients at a higher price and pocket the difference. It is a clubby world: Four or five banks do the vast majority of trades, and the same roster of hedge funds line up to buy the shares, according to the data and market participants.

Wall Street thrives on information edges, and at the beginning of a block deal, the bankers are holding a valuable nugget: They know that a wave of selling is likely on the way. That is because public shareholders, assuming that corporate insiders are better informed, tend to copy their trades. A flood of shares for sale also knocks the supply-demand balance out of kilter.

Regulators suspect that investment banks have been tipping off their top clients, who jump in and sell ahead of that wave, according to people familiar with the probes. In many deals examined by the Journal, the stock-price slide began in late morning or early afternoon, around the time sellers typically alert bankers to their plans.

The ultimate losers in these situations are often pension funds, endowments and foundations. They invest with private-equity firms, which use block trades to unwind stakes in newly public companies.

Bain Capital, which lost out on $33 million after Canada Goose’s stock fell in the final hours of trading before it sold a slug of stock, counts Indiana teachers and Los Angeles city workers among its investors, according to public records. Pension funds are also big investors in Boston-based T.H. Lee Partners, which missed out on at least $31 million of proceeds on five block trades between 2018 and 2021 due to unexplained price declines, trading data show.

Block trades can be risky. Banks compete to buy the shares at slim discounts, and if they misjudge investor demand or there is a sudden, unexpected drop, their profit margin can quickly evaporate.

That creates a financial incentive to leak details ahead of time. Knowing which investors will buy the shares, and at what price, could help a bank fine-tune its bid and decrease its risk of losses. And tipping off top funds to a profitable trade—selling short a stock heading into a block sale tends to be a winner—could curry favor with important clients.

There are other reasons a stock might fall ahead of a block trade. When a company goes public, employees and early investors are usually prevented from selling their shares for a period of time, generally six months. Hedge funds know when those so-called lockups expire and often short the stock ahead of time.

But fewer than 20 block trades in the Journal’s list appear to be linked to the expiration of IPO lockups, and they performed only slightly worse than the rest. In the vast majority of examples, there was no obvious reason the stock might have underperformed.

861,Everyone is short the market heres why you shouldnt,Technical Analysis | BGC,"Look at all you retards buying puts on 10x leverage just because the market went into a little downturn, some of you may have even made money but going into OPEX Wednesday and Thursday that's about to change.

&#x200B;

Why? Negative gamma/delta expiry..... say it with me ""Negative gamma/delta expiry. But anon what is negative gamma and negative delta, worry not little retard Daddy BGC is here to help.

Negative delta is the number of shares that are needed to be shorted in order to hedge selling a put position, eg: -0.67 = 67 shares short. why is this important? because everyone is now loaded to the tits with puts on most indices and shitcos, the Market Makers selling the puts will have to hedge that position and are now short the stock.

Gamma is the rate of change of delta, so higher gamma means a greater increase in the rate of delta, for put options it's the same but the delta is negative. Now, why is negative gamma important? because right now we have a fuckload of negative gamma set to expire on the indices and that will lead to massive decreases in negative delta leading to Market Makers covering short positions.

&#x200B;

Now for the retards in the room on the graph it shows we have around -5 BILLION delta on SPY (Billion with a B) that's a lot of shares that are short. We also have around -1 Billion net gamma.

&#x200B;

As many of you know theta takes without asking and many a retard's account been blown up buying 0DTEs, this is important here because as theta decay exponentially increases we have the value of put contracts decreasing much more quickly as we approach the end of the day. This would cause people to sell their puts leading to a reversal on the indices as market makers rehedge and cover shorts as people sell their puts, this is known as the charm effect.

&#x200B;

We also have a double OPEX both on Wednesday and Thursday so we should see heightened volatility so swings up are exacerbated especially given how much negative delta there is.

We are likely to see another massive bear rally and if there is any good news or the fed walks back a bit we will see SPX 4520 before Thursday's close.

874,"Interest rates, inflation, and where that leaves Gold and the markets.",DD,"**If you are skimming, read the bold.**

With interest rates finally being raised on Wednesday, there’s a lot to look forward to in 2022 as well as the following decade. The FED has announced a 0.25% rate hike with what sounds like a target of 7 this year, leaving the target range somewhere between 1.75%-2.00%. What does this mean? It means money is becoming more expensive to borrow. This results in a tightening of the money supply in both the market and the economy. Borrowed money is permanently returned and removed from the system. To put it simply, imagine your credit card interest rate rising from 10% to 20%: you are not only less inclined to spend, but also pressured to pay off any outstanding debt ASAP. Hence the fear of money(outstanding debt) flowing out of markets and back to the lenders.

Exactly how much is 1.75%, and is it going to be enough to bring down inflation? Well, the inflation rate came in at a reported 7.9% last month. Most of us already know this number is detached from reality, the inflation calculation has been altered over the years to favor government irresponsibility. Using inflation calculations from 1980, the inflation rate would be at 16%. This sounds more reasonable and in line with the price increases we all have experienced.

Source: [http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate\_data/inflation-charts](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts)

https://preview.redd.it/n6buhfirsmo81.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6d35faf42483685ab1147a1ce8283b157e7e33

Below is a chart of interest rates (orange) vs inflation (blue). Every time inflation gets out of control, rates are hiked in order to tame it. Back in the 1970’s, with inflation at around 12%, we needed hikes of 13% to bring it under control. Using the FEDs silly terms, that is 1300 BPS. Again in the 1970’s we saw near 15% inflation and 19% rates (1900 BPS) needed to bring it down. Nearly every year that inflation skyrockets, interest rates need to match or exceed in order to bring it under control. However, there is one difference between now and pre 2008, quantitative easing (aka uncontrolled money printing). When so much of our economy is reliant on printed money (debt), reeling the line back in is an impossible feat without a total collapse.

https://preview.redd.it/osa7xnzssmo81.jpg?width=2050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82fa3e37f2943e44c843c5f3349ed461612ae7bc

One look at 2018 and you begin to see the problem with rising interest rates in a debt dependent economy. **Back in 2015, the FED decided to start raising interest rates to maintain a 2% inflation target for the coming years. This caused a massive strain on markets, resulting in both the NASDAQ and S&P500 dropping \~18% in 2018. After seeing this, the FED promptly reversed the decision.**

The stock market and most assets are completely built upon and reliant on debt. **Quantitative easing has turned our economy into a ponzi scheme with ever ballooning prices. Cutting access to that debt through interest rate hikes begins a cascading effect of “margin calls”. As one person goes to settle their debt, the outflow of money puts pressure on everyone else to repay their outstanding debt.** One of the largest contributing factors to the 1929 market crash was Margin debt. Margin isn’t the problem, uncontrolled debt is.

This is why your schizophrenic, QAnon supporting uncle has been screaming that the global economy is about to crash every year for the past decade. This is at the core of gay bear ideaology. So why hasn’t it happened? And will it happen?

The entire goal of the FED is self preservation, they will do whatever they need to do to keep the economy from exploding. In what scenario will a bank or the FED EVER tell you they don’t have something under control? Doing so would cause panic, bank runs, and your uncle’s wet dream coming true. **The FED will find any reason to keep printing. If 2018 is any indicator, a reversal on rate hikes is inevitable.**

Now moving on to how the recent interest hikes affect gold. **If you don’t know by now, gold is an unproductive asset. It doesn’t produce anything, it doesn’t grow, and it certainly doesn’t offer dividends. Opportunity cost is the price you pay for holding a stable asset while everything else around you is ballooning higher.** **Why hold gold, when you can gain 2% a year from bonds or 8% average from stocks? That premise is all based on the FED taming inflation, resulting in your 2% and 8% gains outpacing inflation.**

**As commodity & energy prices rise, so do the input costs of your favorite tech companies. Everything from running servers, to buying equipment, to maintenance all have energy or commodity costs associated with them**.

Now combine this with consumer spending. **When the average consumer’s bills go up, their consumer good spending plummets.** Let’s take a look at what happens to Jane’s $2500 paycheck as rent, gas prices, and food soars. Jane used to pay $1000 for rent, $400 for food, and $200 in gas/utilities. This left her with about $900 to spend on consumer goods produced by your favorite companies in the stock market. Now that her rent is $1300, food $600, and $300 in utilities, her spending allowance is a third of what it was at $300. Even advertisement centered businesses like facebook/google see profit losses as less buying results in less marketing by companies. **Nearly every company is dependent on the average consumer’s spending in one way or another.**

Ok we get it there’s going to be lower profit margins for stocks, but where does this leave gold? Fundamentally, higher interest rates should mean that it’s more beneficial to secure your money in bonds; but what happens when the real rates (meaning the interest rates adjusted for inflation) are negative? If inflation is rising faster than interest rates, bond buyers are bleeding money.

As many of us know, the market looks ahead 6 months+ attempting to price in any future events. It’s why the stock market was falling before rates were actually hiked, and why so many people complain about the stock market soaring on expected bad news (it was priced in). **Anticipation of bad news suppresses prices. That pressure is lifted when the expected news actually occurs. This is only true for expected events as unexpected events cannot be priced in.**

Gold prices are no different. **Back between 2011 and 2015, gold prices drilled to local lows in anticipation of interest rate hikes.** **No one wanted to hold gold knowing that in a few years the FED would raise interest rates**, their money would be better off in bonds or elsewhere if that happened. This was the market pricing in rate hikes in the price of gold. **The exact month that the FED hiked rates marked the bottom in gold. The following 4 years saw one of the largest bull runs in gold even with interest rates rising.** The price was so suppressed in anticipation of FED responsibility that it ballooned higher when rates slowly increased. Once the FED reversed, and COVID forced interest rates to 0, gold went parabolic all the way to $2000/oz in August 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/yoy0hdbusmo81.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c32c1010dad500e326612fd9a0e949c4d8340c5d

**So here we are again with an 18 month consolidation in gold prices as the market waited in anticipation of rate hikes and FED responsibility. During some of the highest inflation we have seen in US history, gold went from over $2000 in summer of 2020, to reaching $1700 lows near the end of 2021.**

How is this supposed inflation hedge losing value in the 18 months after COVID. Even after massive money printing, record inflation, wars, and every other event that should be sending gold higher?

It all comes down to the market pricing in interest rates and responsibility from the FED, which effectively suppresses the price. The market expected FED “responsibility”, but it’s time to face the music and Powell ain’t dancing. **Now that rate hikes are actually happening, the pressure on gold prices is being lifted.** There is a decade-long bull run in commodities coming and gold is not going to be the only player. Uranium, silver, and gold will be the trade of the decade.

**TLDR: Input costs for stocks rising, consumer spending cut due to inflation bills. Anticipation of rate hikes has suppressed gold prices, actual rate hike always mark the bottom in gold prices historically speaking (buy the rumor, sell the news). Debt dependent economy cannot sustain rate hikes, the fed reversed in rate hikes 2018 after stocks crashed and will do it again.**

**Please at least read the bold in the post.**

50% of my account is in $AG first majestic shares (a junior miner with one of, if not the highest leverage to gold & silver). I also have $6k of options expiring in April in another account but my gameplan is mostly shares due to the difficulty of timing this sector.

My other account positions are in silver miners as well as uranium miners like CCJ. These are mostly hedges against a black swan event in First Majestic. I picked mostly silver miners because I believe it is a higher leverage play on gold prices. If you don’t want to pick specific miners then I suggest $SILJ (junior silver miners) and GDX/GDXJ (gold miners).",tiz2gt,364,137,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tiz2gt/interest_rates_inflation_and_where_that_leaves/

877,Marijuana Legalization bill goes to vote next week,News,"In case you're wondering why all the weed stocks were smoking today.   


**Federal legalization up for vote next week.** 

The House is set to vote on federally legalizing marijuana for the second time in history. The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE Act) previously passed the House in a 228 to 164 vote, as five Republican lawmakers joined Democratic lawmakers in passing this bill. 

**Weeding out the competition**

There are a lot of contenders vying for a foothold in the space. The industry is made up of a wide range of companies involved in each step of the medical and recreational marijuana supply chain.   


* Canopy Growth‘s shares jumped as sales of its other products helped offset a year-over-year decline in Canadian sales of marijuana. 
* Tilray, another Canadian marijuana producer, cut costs and reported surprise profits in the last quarter. Analysts are forecasting an increase of 48% over the next year for Tilray.

**Last time they tried to legalize in 2020,** but after passing the House it died in committee. Weed stocks are in double digits with the news now, but if the bill does not pass, share prices are sure to reset.

880,"Fed raises interest rates for first time in 3 years to fight inflation, forecasts six more hikes in 2022",News,"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/03/16/interest-rates-increase-fed/7052888001/

The COVID-19-induced era of rock-bottom interest rates is over — just as the U.S. finally seems to be turning the corner on the pandemic.

Yet while falling COVID cases and solid consumer demand are helping clear the way for higher rates, the Federal Reserve is taking aim at the pandemic’s stubborn economic legacy: soaring inflation.

Moving to curtail a historic surge in consumer prices, the Fed raised its key short-term interest rate Wednesday – by a quarter-percentage point -- for the first time in more than three years and forecast six more hikes this year. That’s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.

The central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.

“The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,” the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. “The implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.”

What do Fed rate hikes mean?
Traditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.

Wednesday’s hike bumps up the federal funds rate – which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans – from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It’s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.

In its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates ""ongoing increases...will be appropriate.""

Although Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.

Is the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?
The Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. 

Since fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices – Russia is among the world’s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.

Worker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.

Yet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth – all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.

Powell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move “until downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.”

How is the current U.S. economy?
The Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials’ median projections. That’s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.

The Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.

What is inflation rate for 2022?
Inflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.

And with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.

In an opinion piece in Tuesday’s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and “will have to head in a dramatically different direction” to “avoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.”

Other Fed moves
The Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities ""at a coming meeting"" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.

 Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.

Wednesday’s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.

As recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.

He said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment – an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.

But by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.",tfocsi,361,133,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tfocsi/fed_raises_interest_rates_for_first_time_in_3/

Do not trust your account holders to track your holdings accurately. 

Do not trust them to maintain historical records. 

Twice, in my 30+ years of investing, I have had to demand corrections to my 401k account from a former job. 

Both had to do with the vested % of employer contributions somehow being set back to zero (from 60%). 

The first time, since it was the old days, I had the paper docs in a file. They agreed quickly on the error and fixed it. 

The second time, five years ago, I relied on the electronic records through the the T. Rowe Price site, and found them to be inadequate. It was eventually fixed, but that was a lot of frustration. 

Now that I think about it, my record keeping of marital accounts which were not in my name would have come in handy in my divorce. That cost me some $.

888,Global Food Shortage is accelerating - Wheat to 4000,News,"[https://fortune.com/2022/03/24/russia-ukraine-wheat-exports-high-prices/](https://fortune.com/2022/03/24/russia-ukraine-wheat-exports-high-prices/)

For those that don't know.

Russia and Ukraine together account for 35% of global export of wheat and corn, which is nearly double that of the US.

Ukraine alone accounts for more than half that number in terms of corn and a little under half of that in terms of Wheat. With a war going on, farms simply will not produce enough to export, and barely enough to feed their own population due to the disruption in logistics. Seeds, Fuel, Fertilizers and equipment will be hard to come by. The spring planting season is upon us, and if the war does not end in a month, which is highly unlikely, then the entire fall harvest of Ukraine will be in trouble.

Then you have Russia. Russian wheat is all on the west side of the Russia bordering Ukraine and have exported themselves through the black sea. With shipping/transport disrupted in that area, it is unlikely that the Russians can bring those produce to market. Additionally, Russia has already started banning of grain exports to many countries and it is only a matter of time that they do a full export ban to the west (making an exception to China). I think its likely that they foresee the coming fertilizer shortage and want to keep domestic prices down to ensure social stability.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/russia-may-suspend-grain-exports-until-june-30-interfax-2022-03-14/](https://www.reuters.com/business/russia-may-suspend-grain-exports-until-june-30-interfax-2022-03-14/)

Now I will talk about global domestic production. What is happening Russian/Ukraine is already bad enough, but this does not account for the spike in Fertilizer and Fuel prices, which are key inputs to agricultural production. The three main fertilizer groups, Potash, Phosphates and Nitrates are up 2-4x what they were a year ago. Again because of supply disruptions and Russia/Belarus being major producers.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/fertilizer-prices-surge-as-ukraine-war-cuts-supply-leaving-farmers-shocked-11648114381](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fertilizer-prices-surge-as-ukraine-war-cuts-supply-leaving-farmers-shocked-11648114381)

This is stuff that needs to go into the ground in the next 2 months. If prices do not immediately go down 50-80%, many farmers will A) either significantly decrease the amount of acreage under production, or B) use significantly less fertilizers. Both of which will lead to a yield collapse for the fall harvest.

Each of Ukraine, Russia and Fertilizer spike would be bad enough. To give you an idea what happened the last time fertilizer prices doubled, which was in 2007, wheat prices tripled. ZW went from around 400 to 1200 over the span of 1 year from March 2007 to March 2008. In 2010, due to a bad harvest, Russia Temporary banned the export of wheat, Wheat futures doubled from 400-800 over the span of 8 months.

The three compounding with each other will easily create a 4-8x fold increase in the price of wheat from the pre-invasion price of around $700. Wheat will easily hit $3,000 - 6,000 over the next 12 months.

The crazy thing is the market is completely oblivious, wheat is only at 1100, which is only up 30% from pre-invasion.

I got about 20k in /ZW calls and will be loading up more. This should be a 100-300 bagger. I have never seen so much asymmetry in option prices in my 13 years of trading. The market is completely oblivious still relative to the scale of the problem.",tnm2up,352,214,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tnm2up/global_food_shortage_is_accelerating_wheat_to_4000/
889,How to Stop Crying - here's your plan.,Discussion,"TL;DR I'm not doing one. I'm typing all this bullshit to help you. You don't want to read it, don't. Go YOLO your shit into Luckin Coffee, you magnificent retard. I love you.

And don't fucking whine about how this is too long. No one cares and I'm tired of this sub being r/whining.

Alright. 

The market is ruining your life. You don't know if we're at bottom or not. But the market is sure you're a bottom and it's coming back to fuck you like a prison inmate again.

Retail investors are plowing money into the market like it's a dime store hooker. Hedge funds are selling off to take their money. Then the stock prices drop, people panic sell. Hedge funds buy all those cheap ass stocks you sold.

So stop that shit. You're making us look bad. 

I mean fuck. You're get raped two ways and then come back for more? Smarten up.

I know. I know. You want tendies. 

Life is hard. You want to stop falling asleep on your couch while the headboard of your bed bangs the wall while your wife's boyfriend puts his no no in her yes yes.

Shut up. Quit crying. Grab some tissues. Listen up.

1. If you have money in the market that you can't live without, take it out. 

This is some basic bitch shit. A volatile market is not the place to invest your rent money. 

No, I don't want you to be responsible. And I don't give a fuck if you're homeless. I want you to not make dumb, emotional, irrational decisions. That's how we all get out of this mess.

If you already fucked this part up, you can shut up and hold for years. Or you can shut up, sell at a massive loss and give up.

If you're leveraged, quit that shit. Paying 8% interest for money that loses 20% is a bad bet. Stop paying brokers and banks to fuck you.

2) Hedge money.

""But but but what the fuck is that? Is it like shrubbing?""

It's cash you keep as cash that you want to invest later or, if you're more into risk, dump some cash into Inverse Etfs (look them up). 

Basically, when the market goes down, they go up. If you use them right, you get to keep your stocks and not take a loss or even make a profit on the ETFs (the jury is still out on if gold is a good hedge or not).

""But but but hedging? But but but inflation. I'll lose money if it sits there.""

Shut up. Inflation is going away. If you invest right you'll make more than inflation will fuck you. And stop buying dumb shit while inflation is high. Don't fuck yourself. You're already getting fucked.

""Now listen here, dinkface. I don't want to hedge. I want to buy the dip. I'm a big bull. My friends and I show each other our big bull balls and swing our dicks at each other to show that we aren't gay bears.""

Shut up. If you want to brag about what kind of animal you are, go to a fucking furry convention. We're here to make money. Money is like your mom. It doesn't care about how big your balls are and it gets me hookers so I can have threesomes with it.

And, shut up, you're still going to buy the dip. But you're going to buy the dip like a man.

What does that mean?

You buy A LITTLE BIT of stocks on the way down (dollar cost averaging, look it up). Buy a LITTLE BIT more every time they have a big dip.

""But but but I don't want to buy a little. I'm a big boy. I buy stocks big. And what if I miss profits? We're already at the bottom.""

Shut up. You're going to make a fuck ton less if you assume we're at the bottom, spend all your cash and then can't buy stocks when they're even cheaper. Anyone who says they know where the bottom is at is a liar or an idiot. I called it wrong once. I'll probably do it again.

If shit turns around (and wait till that is 100% confirmed, retard), the market isn't going up 800% in a day. You can buy more on the way up and still make money as stocks recover.

""But but but what is a little bit of buying, daddy?""

Quit the daddy shit. It's cool when your mom says it to me. It's creepy when you say it.

Here's a basic rule that will keep you from shitting yourself as you watch your portfolio bleed like it's got a perpetual period.

(And it's a basic fucking rule. I don't think this shit is going to happen so don't chirp about it.)

Whatever you're investing amount is overall, assume you'll lose 50% of that. If that makes your ass pucker, use less money. 

Because that's your total budget. Spend it wisely. Spend it in small amounts.

Lots of idiots plowed all their money back into the market in 2000, 2008 when we were nowhere near bottom. Then they sold at bottom. They hate themselves now. Every minute of every day. Some of them are dead. They died with regret.

Don't be an idiot. Yeah, buying something when it's 20% down feels good. You know what feels better? Buying three times as much of that shit when it's 60% down.

3) Pick your stocks in companies that you will be able to hold for 5 years. Maybe you won't have to hold them that long. Maybe you'll have to hold longer. It's a general rule to give you some direction.

The point is if you buy shit that you have to sell before it recovers, you lose. That's not how buying a dip works. You have to buy it and hold it.

""But but but what do I pick?""

Shut up and choose from these options:

A) Companies that have actual value. If you're smart, look up their p/e p/b ratios. General rule, you want something under 25 p/e and 3 p/b. That's a general rule. Some asshole or kind human will probably give a better benchmark in the comments of this post.

You also want a company that isn't carrying a fuckton of debt. Even when the stock market recovers, things are going to get bad in the economy. If companies go bankrupt you'll be wiping your ass with their stocks.

If you're dumb and don't want to learn simple facts like p/e p/b, just pick big ass companies that don't get destroyed when the economy sucks. 

If you want tech, go with Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. Not some fucking IPO you heard about from a guy on the bus who probably touches girls while they're sleeping.

B) Buy companies that pay dividends (Google it, I'm not listing them). They'll pay you money even if the stock shits the bed. You may not make money but you'll lose less until things recover.

C) We're going into a recession. I'm not going to explain it. If you think I'm wrong you're the stupidest of the stupid. You should take your money out of the market, buy a gun and shoot your foot off to remind you to be smarter and read basic economic data.

When people realize we're going into a big recession, they will freak out and probably sell a lot of stocks. Don't do that. Plan for it. Plan to buy or plan to hold. Earliest it will hit is probably summer but people will probably start to lose their shit when Q1 earnings start coming in and they suck donkey cock.

In a recession (especially after this wallet raping inflation) people have less money to spend on things they want because they have to spend money on things they need. So don't invest in companies that sell expensive shit that people don't need.

Think on what people buy when they're broke. They buy shit at Dollar Tree and Costco (DLTR COST) They buy food at grocery stores (look up the tickers yourself - not high end grocery stores). They buy fast food instead of eating dinner out (MCD). They buy coke products (I mean the drink - KO). They watch shit on tv (pick a streamer). They still buy alcohol and cigarettes (look them up, I don't buy that shit because I'm ethical as fuck and don't invest in it). Consumer staples like toilet paper and toothpaste (PG JNG). And people still get sick and have to see doctors (UHG).

Buy companies that do well in a recession. 

Banks do well in recessions. Banks do well when interest rates are going up (which they are in a big way). Both are happening.

Just know that China's economy is fucked and Russia's economy just got nuked which affected banks all over the world. You might want to see how that global shit works out before you invest in them. Wells Fargo has increased 30% short interest right now (only 1% but still a spike). That's for a reason.

""But but but my dad buys that stable big value company stocks. I want to buy cool stocks like laser guided robotic cat dildos because I'm awesome. I'm smart, edgy and cool.""

Shut up. You're not. And I'll still let you buy those stocks. Just buy less of those and buy the good ones that have actual revenue on the horizon. Research. Like your dad, it's not hard (which is why your mom left him for me).

If you're really fucking smart, you buy a little with the plan to hold. Then, if a bunch or retards pump up a stock 30% based on nothing, sell that shit, wait for it to tank and rebuy.

""But but but HODL! BUY ALL THE DIPS!!!""

Ok. That's fine by me. You're the reason I've made fat cash off of UPST, PLTR, gold and silver (and then rebought them). You're why I made a shitton off of meme stocks last year. Thanks for that.

""But but but what about other investments that I can't talk about here because of this sub's rules?""

I'll be honest, I don't know how that stuff is going to shake out. I am sure that if you invest in a volatile asset and think it's a hedge you're so stupid it hurts your ancestors.

Yeah, it might be a hedge. But no one has proven that. Investment patterns don't support that idea being true. When the NASDAQ is down 20% it isn't a good time to experiment with a new hedge. Don't be the guy who base jumps with a parachute that didn't come with instructions.

Alright. That's it. Now shut up and get back out there. No more whining.

The move comes after Amazon certified to the Federal Trade Commission that it had provided all the information requested by antitrust investigators reviewing the deal. That step put the deal on a regulatory clock with the agency that has now expired, leaving the company free to move forward, a person familiar with the matter said.

Amazon provided the FTC with more than three million documents over the past eight months as part of the review process, the person familiar with the matter said.

Even though the deadline has expired, the commission would still have the ability to challenge the acquisition later, if a majority on the FTC votes to do so. The five-member commission is currently split 2-2 between Democrats and Republicans, with one vacancy. A President Biden nominee for the open seat remains pending in the Senate. An FTC spokeswoman declined to comment.

House Formally Advances Federal Marijuana Legalization Bill For Floor Vote, With Praise From Pelosi

By: Kyle Jaeger March 31st 2022

The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved the final rule to advance a bill to federally legalize marijuana to a floor vote, which is expected to happen on Friday.

Members on both sides of the aisle were given the chance to debate the final rule for the process to consider the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act that was approved by the House Rules Committee on Wednesday. 
And Rep. Ed Perlmutter,, who served as manager of the rule for the floor debate, took the opportunity to put pressure on the Senate to finally act on cannabis reform.

https://www.marijuanamoment.net/house-begins-debate-on-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill-with-praise-from-pelosi-ahead-of-floor-vote/

""The House is acting again this week to urge the Senate to finally pass meaningful cannabis reform legislation,"" Perlmutter said, adding that the House has passed his more incremental marijuana banking reform bill six times without seeing action in the opposite chamber.

""The House will pass the More Act this week,"" he said. ""It is clear that Congress needs to reform our broken cannabis laws to better respond to the 47 states across the country who have [legalized] some level of marijuana use.""",tt8qju,329,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tt8qju/house_formally_advances_federal_marijuana/

Okta, an authentication company used by thousands of organizations around the world, says it’s investigating news of a potential breach, [*Reuters* reports](https://www.reuters.com/technology/authentication-services-firm-okta-says-it-is-investigating-report-breach-2022-03-22/). The disclosure comes as hacking group Lapsus$ has posted screenshots to its Telegram channel claiming to be of Okta’s internal systems, including one that appears to show Okta’s Slack channels, and another with a Cloudflare interface.

Any hack of Okta could have major ramifications for the companies, universities, and government agencies that depend upon Okta to authenticate user access to internal systems.

Writing in its Telegram channel, Lapsus$ claims to have had “Superuser/Admin” access to Okta’s systems for two months, but said its focus was “only on Okta customers.” [*The Wall Street Journal* notes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/okta-investigates-reports-of-a-digital-breach-11647931174?mod=hp_lista_pos2) that in a recent filing Okta said it had over 15,000 customers around the world. It lists the likes of Peloton, Sonos, T-Mobile, and the FCC as customers [on its website](https://www.okta.com/customers/).

In a statement sent to *The Verge*, Okta spokesperson Chris Hollis downplayed the incident, and said Okta has not found evidence of an ongoing attack. “In late January 2022, Okta detected an attempt to compromise the account of a third party customer support engineer working for one of our subprocessors. The matter was investigated and contained by the subprocessor.” Hollis said. “We believe the screenshots shared online are connected to this January event.”

“Based on our investigation to date, there is no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January,” Hollis continued. However, writing in their Telegram channel, [Lapsus$ suggested](https://twitter.com/_mg_/status/1506117831095586818?s=21) that it had access for a few months.",tk510d,327,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tk510d/okta_hack_puts_thousands_of_businesses_on_high/

Let me explain why. This is an optionsscheine. Apparently, it's a derivative, kind of like an option and kind of like a warrant.

But here is the catch, this is what's termed a knock-out warrant, it means that if the prices reaches a determined gain or loss in value, it is automatically closed.

I also read from a user that in the German Market, these are not open market derivatives and are controlled by the sole issuer who can close the position at any point in time. (Don't know how accurate that is), but, its a positive and negative knock-out warrant.

&#x200B;

This means that the gains are capped, and you inherit greater risk of losses because if it falls below a fixed price whether positive or negative, they close out your position on you.

This fucking retard threw $600.00 bucks at a Swiss military stock as a long shot bet, and got 4,957.28% gain on a god damn knock-out warrant.

Talk about retarded and talk about wow. You enjoy those gains buddy u/Guns-and-Pumpkins.

I don't know about you guys, but this shit is amazing to see in comparison to the rich daddy money that gets thrown around in here.

Optionsscheine are by far way more riskier then our options and warrants. Shits crazy.

Edit: By the way, these are not Rubles here, these are in Euro dollars.

Edit: Seems as per a comment below, it does just say optionsscheine and would then be just a regular options trade. Never the less, still very impressive.

But what was explained above is true. They’re such things as knock-out turbo optionsscheine, turbo bull optionsscheine, etc that are exactly as what I wrote above.

The fact that, that is a sort of derivative that can be traded still fascinates me 😂",tfvgbd,326,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tfvgbd/i_dont_care_what_you_say_this_retard_deserves/

This was followed up by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also [banning the same Russian state owned refiners today](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palladium-extends-gains-suspension-russian-234518049.html). Additionally the Japanese Exchange Group's Osaka exchange is now also reviewing whether or not to ban Russian Palladium and Platinum refiners. This has major implications in the Palladium market, as Russia [produces about 40% of the world's Palladium.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s72z1u/how_to_profit_off_a_russian_invasion_of_ukraine/) Russia's Palladium and Platinum exports were one of the very last major Russian exports left that were not subject to any major sanctions. As civilian deaths mount in the Russo-Ukrainian War, more and more pressure will mount on Western governments and financial regulators to cut Russia further out of the world markets. Any removal of Russian palladium from the world market gives an excellent opportunity for non-Russian Palladium producers to profit. Aside from Russia, major palladium mines are located in South Africa, the United States and Canada. Palladium is used heavily in both the car industry and electronics industry, being used in both catalytic converters and integrated circuits. If major automakers and chip makers are no longer allowed to buy Russian Palladium, they will be all forced to compete for Palladium produced by companies like Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW) which controls nearly all of American Palladium mining production and has major mines in South Africa, and Impala Platinum Holdings (JSE: IMP) which has major Canadian and South African mines.

I know that you’re likely heavily invested in Etsy, and that’s why that **bubble of diarrhea is trading at a PE of 44**, Which is a true display of retardation in itself.

But it turns out that Etsy has pulled a move so autistic it makes you degenerates look like you actually know what you’re doing YOLOing your life savings on great investments like $Wish or even $ETSY which has **already** lost -50% in 3months.

It is a move so retarded that it makes you apes look like Harvard graduate businessmen.

Etsy has taken a step straight out of Mein Kampf and gone full fucking Nazi on their own sellers.

*but why would they fuck their own sellers? After all, the sellers are* ***the product*** *of their business*

Surprisingly good question retards, here’s why and how:

* They used their huge increase in capital from the Covid period to acquire any relevant competitor. They are holding their market share almost as tight as your wife holds your boyfriends schlong.
* Now that they’re controlling the sales of thousands of middle aged women who sell macaroni-necklaces, they can take as much of a cut as they want. (This in itself is borderline a violation of the anti-competition laws that Biden is actively fighting for)
* They have done a pro move, they’ve increased their revenue. But the cost of that majestically autistic move worthy of the front page of a Guiness-world-record book is that their sellers are now planning a strike.
* Not only are they planning a strike/boycott, they have already started creating their own websites, bringing market shares away from NaziEtsy.

*as much of a cut as they want… how bad can it be?*

**Really fucking bad.**

It turns out these top-shelf retards have increased the amount they tax their sellers by **30%**  compared to what they charged a few months ago.

**This brings the fees to 6,5% of the displayed price. The seller then has to pay for shipping and packaging too.**

**And TAXES. Don’t forget that the IRS will fuck  you, your wife and her boyfriend if you don’t pay taxes on those sweet NaziEtsy tendies gained from selling macaroni necklaces.**

**This has pushed the sellers over the limit.**

Their sellers were already complaining about the massive fees that Etsy taxed before, but now these middle aged women will have to double up their production to be on the same level as the children in China that made the device you’re reading this post on.

Now, let’s use whatever brain cells you retards have acquired since your professional investment journey started back when you got cockblocked by Vlad And RobbingDaHood.

If your entire business model is connecting buyers to middle aged women and take a cut on their sales, how retarded do you have to be to royally piss these middle aged women off? Answer: top tier retardation is required.

And that’s what Etsy have done. They have pissed of so many middle aged women, Karens and your wife’s aunt that their own sellers are planning a **MASSIVE STRIKE**

[**READ THIS, this post has over 20k upvotes in less than 24hours and the PETITION has over 5000 Signatures**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/tk0z3v/will_you_help_us_expose_them_details_in_comment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

These sellers have formed an alliance of terrifying PISSED middle aged women to go on Strike and Boycott Etsy.

That’s right… Etsy’s own product is leaving them.

Speaking of leaving, I have spoken to some of these sellers because I actually do some research between retarded YOLO’s

They are a group of sellers, they are reaching out to A LOT of media and news outlets all over the world. They are contacting influencers and even some dancing weirdos on Tiktok with big following.  


**!! 20:00 GMT -- Media update !!**  
Since reaching out this morning, two news outlets have picked up on the story already:  
**- One of the group members has confirmed that The Verge  has reached out and agreed to write an article.**  
**- Fucking BuzzFeed has also agreed to write an article**

&#x200B;

Etsy has pissed their own sellers off so much that they are going to get fucked in the most majestical way possible.

**POSITIONS**:

\-Sold out of Etsy entirely

\-Leveraged short positions with stop-losses ranging from 65% to 87%

\-Total of your wife’s retirement fund invested: \~23k

I’ll see you retards around the bonfire that’s about to be the size of a $18b shitcompany, I’ll bring the marshmallows. Tell your wife to bring the cake.

Edit: some fat fingered spelling

EDIT 2: Why is the increase to 6,5% so important as to trigger a strike:

>u/nhaodzo said it perfectly:  
>  
>It's not only the transaction fee.  
>  
>They charge:  
>  
>\- (soon to be) 6.5% on transaction fee of the total purchase (so if the item is $400 and shipping is $10, they they charge 6.5% on $410)  
>  
>\- 3% processing fee  
>  
>\-fixed $.25 processing fee  
>  
>\-fixed $.2 listing fee.  
>  
>So for $400 transaction, you have to pay Etsy $38.45  
>  
>And then all the packaging, label, labor...Maybe you can make a little profit, but then you get taxed the f out of your already bitten in half tendie.

This is huge. This is a game changer. Biggest opportunity of a lifetime.

&#x200B;

Delisting is now most likely just fear. China is willing to accept all audits from USA with only a CERTAIN SUBSET of stocks. One of them being Alibaba. China isn't guaranteeing for all its listed stocks but only some.

Also, do you hold tech stocks and believe the rapid growth of technology will continue to dominate markets? Or do you think it is a valuation bubble/progress will slow?

Here are a few of my picks:

- DIS: Worth 250B, but own (or partly own) ESPN, Hulu, Marvel, LucasFilms, ABC, 20th Century, list goes on. Disney+ growing in popularity as well, and Disney parks will be packed/are already packed as people worry less about COVID relative to before.

- AMZN: Maybe on a dip. Besides their massive eCommerce empire, AWS cloud storage makes the most of their revenue and continues to revolutionize the cloud (used by many companies from Tesla, Snapchat, Volkswagen, etc.).

- CRM: There is currently a shortage of SalesForce devs because the demand has been growing for them. Like the above stocks, used by many major companies (AWS, Spotify, Toyota, AMEX). 

- CRSP: Riskier play, but gene editing would be a massive breakthrough and they are and have been the leaders for a while.",tse35a,308,434,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tse35a/what_are_your_long_term_holds_and_is_a_large/

And that is why we say that having a certain kind of temperament is more important than brains. You need to keep raw irrational emotion under control. You need patience and discipline and an ability to take losses and adversity without going crazy. You need an ability to not be driven crazy by extreme success.”  

 “We have three baskets: in, out, and too tough. … We have to have a special insight, or we’ll put it in the “too tough” basket.” 

“There is no better teacher than history in determining the future... There are answers worth billions of dollars in 30$ history book.” 

 “Acquire worldly wisdom and adjust your behavior accordingly. If your new behavior gives you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group…then to hell with them.” 

 “I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines.

1006,Booked my Train Ticket on the Tilray Express just yesterday,Discussion,"Good morning fellow gorillas. It's been 14 straight months that I have been watching $TLRY get it's ass pounded. I was here for weed gang 1.0 last March and have seen the price slowly dwindle from $22.00 all the way down to $4.88. Over the past 4 months I've been slowly buying shares and had $7000 total in shares as of last Thursday. Woke up yesterday to shares being up 30% and figured it was going to be another streak of news bumping the price up for a day or two and then coming back down like it has every other day for the last 14 months, so I sold all my shares to buy back in on the price drop. It wasn't until about 1:00 pm that I realized congress is voting on federal legalization of marijuana again. With the house voting next week, I realized I made a mistake in selling. Bought back in at about 3:00 pm and bought another $2000 in shares. I'm sitting at $10,802.70 right now with markets closed.

Now I know what you guys might be thinking, ""What is this guy, fucking retarded?"" and yes, you would be right. But allow me and my 70 points of IQ to explain why the next few weeks are going to be wild. Ballotpedia shows the makeup of congress before and after the 2020 election. Check the subheading ""Partisan Balance""

Last time this was voted on, the house was a clean sweep with 228 for and 164 against. Then stalled in the senate. This time around there is still a blue majority in the house. If that passes, it's smooth sailing until it reaches the senate again. This time around were looking at 48/50 blue/red in the senate vs the 45/53 the last time this happened. Not only that, but it's been over a year since then I'm betting that time will slowly turn government heads in favor of recreational marijuana. This would open many doors for companies that are waiting on this lottery ticket and I'm betting that the growth of these companies and the hype around cannabis stocks is going to take this sky high.

Glad there aren't many eyes on this at the moment with all the GME hype. I've been trying to save up to go back to graduate school, so if this fails at least I know I was too stupid to go back to college anyways. If this shit goes tits up, I'll make sure my friends have my login info so they can post my obituary to WSB when I invest in $ROPE.

Weed gang 2.0 is on the horizon and I've booked my ticket on the Tilray train. Diamond hands to the moon baby. I'll keep you updated on my positions throughout the week. What do you guys think about all of this?

1010,Tesla Needs Lithium. Elon Musk Suggests It Might Get Into the Mining Business.,Industry News,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk lamented the rising cost of lithium in a recent tweet. He even suggested that Tesla might get into the mining business to help solve shortages of the key raw material that goes into rechargeable lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries.

Tesla-as-miner has far-reaching implications for the EV industry. Will locking up long-term lithium supply become a strategic imperative for the industry? Will other auto companies look to backward integrate into the EV battery supply chain? Those are longer term questions for investors to ponder. More immediately, lithium mining stocks—most likely the smaller ones—could react wildly in Monday trading. The larger, more established, players include Albemarle (ticker: ALB), Liven t (LTHM) and SQM (SQM). ( Livent still qualifies as a small capitalization stock.)

Three smaller players include Piedmont Lithium (PLL), Lithium Americas (LAC) and Sigma Lithium (SGML.Canada). The three large players have a combined market capitalization of more than $50 billion. The three smaller players, which are in different stages of ramping up new projects, have a combined market cap of less than $10 billion. “Price price of lithium has gone to insane levels!” tweeted Musk on April 8.

He has a point. Benchmark lithium prices are at about $78,000 a metric ton, up almost 80% year-to-date. The price for a basket of battery materials Barron’s tracks is up about 60% year-to-date, theoretically adding roughly $2,000 to the price of an EV. Most battery materials, however, are bought on a contract basis. Most commodity prices quoted are spot prices. When spot is greater than contract, it is a sign that contract prices will move higher.

“Tesla might have to get into the mining \[and \] refining directly at scale,” said Musk, adding in a later tweet “we have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction \[and\] refinement.”

Scale doesn’t appear to be the big issue. There are large miners such as Albemarle that produce lithium for well less than $10,000 a metric ton, according to company documents and Barron’s calculations. What’s more, everyone in the lithium industry is investing for growth. Wall Street expects Albemarle’s capital spending to be about $1.4 billion in 2022, more than double levels from just a few years ago.

Current spot prices are good enough for miners to put capital into the ground. Instead, the issues appear to be EV demand growth, which is happening faster than people, and the time it takes for the mining industry to ramp up new capacity.

>**Meat, sausage and dairy products are to become “significantly more expensive” from Monday**, as the group confirms. According to information from our editorial team, a surcharge of around **30 percent is planned for butter.**

>Because of the war, **there is currently no (livestock food) supply**. Because there is no feed for the animals, fewer pigs, cattle and above all chickens are raised. ""Food in Germany now costs more money than ever before,"" writes the agricultural organ ""Agrarheute

>Because of their sheer size alone, **Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord are trendsetters when it comes to pricing in German food retail.** ""We expect that the sales prices in the entire trade will rise considerably in the coming months,""

>“Aldi will remain the price leader.

1048,The basics of what happened today,DD,"  

The main driver for today's volatile trading session was the scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting to discuss the Federal Reserve's monetary policy plan. The market sentiment was that the Fed would announce a more ""hawkish"" (a more aggressive plan) tightening of its monetary policy. So what does this all mean? 

Monetary policy has two main levers, the money supply, and interest rates. Without getting too deep in the weeds, the **money supply** is the quantity of money circulating in the economy. As the central bank, the Federal Reserve creates money by buying assets and adding them to its balance sheet. These transactions are primarily US Government bonds and mortgage backed securities. The Federal Reserve was aggressive by expanding the balance sheet to over $8.9 trillion through March of 2022. 

&#x200B;

[Nearly $9 trillion on the balance sheet!!!](https://preview.redd.it/7nkyoc7g8zr81.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=63dcd2d1f9174e7cb5436bd9565e4d02ce721a73)

The **interest rates** are controlled through the Fed Fund Rate Spread. Essentially, the Central Bank sets two rates, one to lend and one to borrow. For example, the Federal Reserve's current interbank lending rate is 0.50%. So, large banks and financial institutions can borrow from the Federal Reserve for 0.50%. Alternatively, the current interbank borrow rate is 0.25%. So, large banks and financial institutions can lend to the Central Bank for 0.25%. The spread creates boundaries for the interbank lending market as its participants have to stay within this spread. The Fed Fund Rate was historically low at 0.00%-0.25% throughout the pandemic.

To summarize, the money supply impacts the amount of money in the economy—the more money working in the economy, the more money available to spur growth. Similarly, the lower the interest rate, the lower the cost for companies and consumers to borrow money to spend in the economy. 

What happened today? The FOMC held a scheduled meeting and released the meeting details at 2 PM eastern. The markets slumped with anticipation of hawkish guidance from the Fed. The two main points from the meeting were that the Central Bank did have an aggressive plan to combat inflation. First, the Fed announced it would look to begin shrinking the balance sheet for the first time since 2019 and indicated that the balance sheet reduction could begin as soon as May. Second, the Fed announced that all members would be in favor of one or more 50 basis point rate hikes, which is double the typical rate increment of 25 basis points.

Why does this matter? The lower money supply and higher interest rates hurt potential economic growth. There's less money to go around, and the available money costs more to borrow at higher rates. The Fed effectively raised the discount rate resulting in lower firm valuations in fundamental terms. 

What does this mean for investors and traders? The market will likely continue to experience high volatility and will go through a price discovery cycle in the short term. Simply put, traders who can trade volatility should love this, while permabull type traders will likely have some rough waters ahead. This should be considered a positive for investors as there will be quality entry point opportunities. Additionally, and maybe most importantly, this move should lead to a healthy and strong economy in the long term.",txx4d8,264,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/txx4d8/the_basics_of_what_happened_today/

Do I just need to put in $10k and let it go for the year?  And assume that I can put in $10k each year after?  

If an emergency arrises I can pull the purchase it seems?  Just take a 3 month penalty if held less than 5 years?

1055,Portfolio for a rising interest rate and high inflation environment,,"I'm thinking about how to position myself for a high inflation and rising interest rates environment. My current thesis is this:

- Rising interest rates, and thereby a rising risk-free rate, are going to compress multiples in the broad stock market. This makes investing in broad index ETFs less attractive as in the past decade, as the returns are likely low if not negative.

- Bonds are losing value when interest rates rise. Therefore investing in bonds before a period of rising rates is not advisable

- Cash loses value quickly due to high inflation

Therefore, I see two possible options for positioning myself:

1. Investing into different markets outside of EU/US where the environment might be different

2. Going overweight into banking sector ETFs. Banks profit from rising interest rates and could come out on top in such an environment. However, if the rising rates lead to a general market sell of and/or a recession the bank stocks might also lose value.

Of course, the whole thesis builds on the assumption that interest rates will be rising for some time and inflation does not magically go away when supply chain issues are resolved.

What are your thoughts on this? Am I going wrong somewhere?",tyb0ef,262,247,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tyb0ef/portfolio_for_a_rising_interest_rate_and_high/

1061,Alibaba to Buy Back Up to $25 Billion of Stock,News,"The modified repurchase program will be effective for two years through March 2024


Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -4.35% boosted its share buyback program to $25 billion from $15 billion, in a bid to reassure investors about the company’s prospects after a year in which its stock has fallen by more than half.

The potential buybacks are substantial compared with the Chinese e-commerce giant’s market value: As of Monday, it had a market capitalization of about $270 billion, according to FactSet.

The modified repurchase program will be effective for two years through March 2024, Alibaba BABA -4.35% said on Tuesday morning Hong Kong time. It said the 67% increase in the firepower allocated for buybacks was “a sign of confidence about the company’s continued growth in the future.”

Chinese technology stocks in Hong Kong, China and in the U.S.—where they are listed as American depositary receipts—have been highly volatile recently amid worries that U.S. regulators may move to delist Chinese companies as soon as 2024 and signs that Beijing’s long-running regulatory crackdown will continue.


Alibaba’s New York Stock Exchange-listed ADRs are down nearly 13% so far this year—and have fallen about 57% over the past 12 months—according to FactSet. Its stock also trades in Hong Kong, where shares rose about 4% in early trading on Tuesday.

Alibaba said it repurchased about $9.2 billion worth of ADRs as of March 18 under its previous program.

Separately, the company said Weijian Shan, executive chairman of investment group PAG, would join the board as an independent director starting March 31. Ericsson Chief Executive Börje Ekholm, who has served on the board since 2015, will step down the same day, Alibaba said.",tjtv4o,257,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tjtv4o/alibaba_to_buy_back_up_to_25_billion_of_stock/

1064,HMHC June 22.5 calls will 10-20x by next Friday,DD | HMHC,"So, you want alpha, anon? Well, let me spoon feed you it.

**TLDR: HMHC June 22.5 calls will 10 - 20x and HMHC stock will +15% by next Friday (May, Sept, Jan calls will print too).** Run the math yourself: [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) 

Veritas has offered to buy HMHC at $21/share. Multiple prominent shareholders have stated publicly that they will be declining this low-bid offer but would be open at a fairer price ($25-$28). The deadline to decide all this is April 6. Once the shareholders decline this low-bid offer on April 6, Veritas will need to raise the offer +15% to win this asset, and still earn a monster 28% - 37% internal rate of return for their LPs (world class returns for private equity). ***This will send the June $22.5 calls up 10 to 20x instantly.*** 

**Here's why the buyout will not go through at this low price:**

Every shareholder who wanted to sell for $21 has already sold their shares for $21, as the stock has been trading at $21 for over a month now… They have had since February 22 to do so. (Math: 4M average daily volume \* 28 trading days since shares went to $21/share = 112M shares traded. There are 127M shares outstanding). Importantly, this means that the shareholders that remain in the stock are not interested in ""voting"" for this sale to Veritas for $21, unless the price is increased to a fairer price ($25 to $28+). This is not being reflected in the prices of the options = alpha to be had.  

According to Computershare: by March 29, ***two days before the original April 1 deadline, only 0.6% of shares were tendered in support of selling at this low price***, before Veritas extended that deadline one week. Source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220329005578/en/Expiration-Date-of-Tender-Offer-for-Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt-Extended-to-April-6-2022](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220329005578/en/Expiration-Date-of-Tender-Offer-for-Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt-Extended-to-April-6-2022)

***99.4% of shareholders refused to give up their shares at $21 which means a significant premium above $21 is needed for an acquirer win this asset, not for a measly 10% or 15%.*** Not yet reflected in the price = alpha.

**Here's why it’s in Veritas best interests to increase the bid +20% to win this asset:**

Veritas owns Cambium another leading EdTech business which would be a highly complementary asset to HMHC. They can be merged to realize synergies worth billions of dollars. 

Veritas managers are highly intelligent and would not say no to doing a deal at a 31% internal rate of return, just because they could not get the deal done at a 38% internal rate of return. 

Even if Veritas does not increase the bid, the market is determining the fair price of this asset. A rejected buyout offer demonstrates that $21 is too low a price, and the shares will likely rally regardless.

As the title reads, a number of boomers in the senate are going to pass a legislation to ban the import of Russian URANIUM, and as of writing, uranium stocks are currently brrrrrrring. Now, Russia supplies 6% of total uranium in the market.. BUUUUUTTTTTTT, it does supply **41% of the whole ENRICHED URANIUM** in the entire gawd damn world, and what better company to do it than ticker **BWXT** who already has multiple projects with the government. There are only a handful of public companies that enriches uranium (outside Russia and Kazakhstan), i only know of BWX Technologies and a certain fuel broker that gets its enriched uranium from Russia and resells it. Anyhow, what I would like to ask is, is it better to position on uranium miners or the uranium enrichers/processors/services? Or just take a position oin both?

In comparison, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey holds a 2.25% stake. This move comes after Musk's criticism of Twitter for ""failing to adhere to free speech principles"" and recent announcement to his 80 million followers that he's giving some ""serious thought"" to building his own social media platform. After news of the purchase broke, Twitter shares jumped more than 25% in pre-market. Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/04/twitter-shares-soar-more-than-25percent-after-elon-musk-takes-9percent-stake-in-social-media-company.html)

Trailblazer Elon Musk has decided to invest in Twitter instead of becoming its rival. According to experts, Twitter isn't going anywhere but up. It is the go-to platform for ""real-time conversations"" and where influential people share their thoughts with no editing. Twitter is also building out competitive features such as groups and downvoting, while its audio-capable Twitter Spaces is becoming very popular with journalists.

It's hard to know what to expect in this new era of investing, where a single tweet can cause markets to react wildly and immediately. If you're thinking of following in Musk's footsteps and taking a stake in Twitter, here's a strategy based on solid math and protective hedging, instead of extreme hype.

# “These 3 Charts Strongly Suggest the U.S. Stock Market Has an Invisible Hand Propping It Up” By Pam Martens: March 23, 2022

As someone who has watched trading screens for the past 36 years, it’s pretty easy to spot a fake market. As the charts below indicate, there is an invisible hand (or hands) pushing this stock market up when it should be plunging. The likely suspects are U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s Plunge Protection Team, known as [the Exchange Stabilization Fund](https://archive.ph/9NWoh); foreign central banks that are aligned with the U.S. position on Ukraine and want to help stabilize financial markets in the West; hedge funds and [Wall Street’s Dark Pools](https://archive.ph/f2Pin) owned by megabanks that are net long the market; or a combination of all of the above.

One thing’s for sure, the stock market is not responding in a normal fashion to soaring inflation, a hawkish Fed, spiking interest rates, and military aggression by an out-of-control dictator with 6,000 nuclear warheads.

Consider the chart below: since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has skyrocketed by 20 percent, currently reaching 2.38 percent. That was a correct and normal reaction since inflation is already soaring in the U.S. and the military aggression is going to disrupt oil and gas supplies from Russia via sanctions, thus likely pushing commodity prices even higher. In a normally functioning stock market, an increase in yield of that magnitude on the 10-year Treasury note would have caused the stock market to plunge. Instead, per the chart below, the S&P 500 stock index has actually risen 5 percent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The stock market’s bizarre behavior is further evidenced by the chart below. It shows how the S&P 500 stock index has performed in relation to the S&P GSCI commodity index since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Notice particularly how the dramatic spike in commodity prices between February 24 and March 8 was not met with a dramatic plunge in stock prices during that same period. It should have been. Then there is the equally important fact of a big yawn from the stock market as a nuclear power invades a sovereign nation of 44 million people, bombs its cities and towns to rubble, and persists in making threats against the U.S. and allies that are supporting Ukraine.

And, finally, there is the disparate reaction of the stock market versus the correct share price reaction of the global banks that will be impacted by the Russian invasion. The chart below shows the radically different response from the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500 index, versus global banks since February 1, 2022. We selected the date of February 1 because that was the point at which Russia had amassed 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders, backed up with tanks and artillery. The global banks shown on the chart below are those with significant exposure to Russia. The worst performing of these, Austria’s Raiffeisenbank, has lost 50 percent of its value while the S&P 500 is down less than one percent from February 1 as of yesterday’s market close.

The stock market is supposed to be an efficient pricing mechanism. When it stops efficiently pricing risk, it loses the public’s confidence. Those invisible hands should think long and hard about that reality.

1108,Saudi Arabia Considers Accepting Yuan Instead of Dollars for Chinese Oil Sales,Industry News,"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-considers-accepting-yuan-instead-of-dollars-for-chinese-oil-sales-11647351541](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-considers-accepting-yuan-instead-of-dollars-for-chinese-oil-sales-11647351541?st=ma7jg4ogvjk0r5h&reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter)

Saudi Arabia is in active talks with Beijing to price its some of its oil sales to China in yuan, people familiar with the matter said, a move that would dent the U.S. dollar’s dominance of the global petroleum market and mark another [shift by the world’s top crude exporter toward Asia](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-invites-chinas-xi-to-visit-kingdom-amid-strained-u-s-relations-11647284211?mod=article_inline).

The talks with China over yuan-priced oil contracts have been off and on for six years but have accelerated this year as the Saudis have [grown increasingly unhappy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-emirati-leaders-decline-calls-with-biden-during-ukraine-crisis-11646779430?mod=article_inline) with decades-old U.S. security commitments to defend the kingdom, the people said.

The Saudis are angry over the U.S.’s lack of support for their intervention in [the Yemen civil war](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-fight-to-turn-the-tide-in-yemens-civil-war-11647180197?mod=article_inline), and over the Biden administration’s [attempt to strike a deal with Iran](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-nuclear-talks-break-off-without-a-deal-11646997132?mod=article_inline) over its nuclear program. Saudi officials have said they were shocked by the precipitous [U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/last-u-s-troops-leave-afghanistan-after-nearly-20-years-11630355853?mod=article_inline) last year.

China buys more than 25% of the oil that Saudi Arabia exports. If priced in yuan, those sales would boost the standing of China’s currency. The Saudis are also considering including yuan-denominated futures contracts, known as the petroyuan, in the pricing model of [Saudi Arabian Oil Co](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SA/XSAU/2222). , known as Aramco.

It would be a profound shift for Saudi Arabia to price even some of its roughly 6.2 million barrels of day of crude exports in anything other than dollars. The majority of [global oil sales](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-markets-dow-update-03-15-2022-11647333255?mod=article_inline)—around 80%—are done in dollars, and the Saudis have traded oil exclusively in dollars since 1974, in a deal with the Nixon administration that included security guarantees for the kingdom. 

China [introduced yuan-priced oil contracts in 2018](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-attempts-to-supplant-dollar-face-historic-difficulties-1522063947?mod=article_inline) as part of its efforts to make its currency tradable across the world, but they haven’t made a dent in the dollar’s dominance of the oil market. For China, using dollars has become a hazard highlighted by U.S. sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program and on Russia in response to [the Ukraine invasion](https://wsj.com/livecoverage/latest-updates/russia-ukraine-latest-news).

China has stepped up its courtship of the Saudi kingdom. In recent years, China has helped Saudi Arabia [build its own ballistic missiles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-begin-making-ballistic-missiles-with-chinese-help-11640294886?mod=article_inline), consulted on a nuclear program and begun investing in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s pet projects, [such as Neom](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-crown-princes-vision-for-neom-a-desert-city-state-tests-his-builders-11619870401?mod=article_inline), a futuristic new city. Saudi Arabia has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping [to visit later this year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-invites-chinas-xi-to-visit-kingdom-amid-strained-u-s-relations-11647284211?reflink=mobilewebshare_twitter&mod=article_inline).

Meanwhile the Saudi relationship with the U.S. has deteriorated under President Biden, who said in the 2020 campaign that [the kingdom should be a “pariah](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-urged-to-penalize-saudi-crown-prince-over-khashoggi-killing-11614546231?mod=article_inline)” for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Prince Mohammed, who U.S. intelligence authorities say ordered Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, refused to sit in on a call between Mr. Biden and the Saudi ruler, King Salman, last month.

It also comes as the U.S. economic relationship with the Saudis is diminishing. The U.S. is now among the top oil producers in the world. It once imported 2 million barrels of Saudi crude a day in the early 1990s but those numbers have fallen to less than 500,000 barrels a day in December 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

By contrast, China’s oil imports have swelled over the last three decades, in line with its expanding economy. Saudi Arabia was China’s top crude supplier in 2021, selling at 1.76 million barrels a day, followed by Russia at 1.6 million barrels a day, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs.

“The dynamics have dramatically changed. The U.S. relationship with the Saudis has changed, China is the world’s biggest crude importer and they are offering many lucrative incentives to the kingdom,” said a Saudi official familiar with the talks.

“China has been offering everything you could possibly imagine to the kingdom,” the official said.",terrhf,235,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/terrhf/saudi_arabia_considers_accepting_yuan_instead_of/

1126,SoftBank liquidates most of portfolio at ‘Nasdaq whale’ trading unit,Industry News,"SoftBank has liquidated almost all of the positions in its abortive internal hedge fund SB Northstar after racking up between $6bn and $7bn in losses in the unit behind the notorious “Nasdaq whale” trades. 

The future of the Japanese technology conglomerate’s buccaneering trading unit has been in doubt since November, when SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son told investors “the company called SB Northstar . . . is about to come to an end”.  

Akshay Naheta, the former Deutsche Bank trader based in Abu Dhabi who ran the unit, left SoftBank on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter. The 40-year-old is known for executing complex derivative transactions and earned notoriety for spearheading SoftBank’s controversial bet on the shares of fraudulent payments company Wirecard.  

Regulatory filings show that SB Management — Northstar’s investment manager — held a little over $1bn in US-listed stocks at the end of 2021, down from more than $17bn one year earlier. The bulk of its remaining positions were in special purpose acquisition companies, including vehicles sponsored by its own Vision Fund, SoftBank shareholder Elliott Management and Vision Fund investor Mubadala.  

The winding down of Northstar comes as SoftBank looks to slow investments across the group as it seeks to raise cash amid falling tech stocks and a regulatory crackdown in China. 

A person familiar with its portfolio said that most of its European investments were liquidated around the same time, including a $5bn bet on Swiss drugmaker Roche that had been profitable. The person added that there were less than a handful of positions left, which had been transferred to SoftBank Group. 

“I don’t think there’s a reason for them to dump anything else immediately, because there are other things that they can sell that are more liquid,” he said, noting that a recent rebound in SoftBank’s Chinese technology stocks had eased pressure on the group to raise cash. 

In its 2021 annual results presentation last month, SoftBank disclosed that Northstar had lost $4.6bn over the course of its brief existence, mainly because of disastrous derivative bets. One person familiar with its trading activity said this would likely climb to $6bn following the liquidation, while another pegged it at close to $7bn.  

SoftBank said: “As Mr Son explained during SoftBank’s earnings presentation last November, SB Northstar’s activities and its portfolio have been significantly reduced.”  

SoftBank launched Northstar in August 2020 with initial capital of $555mn — a third of this coming from Son himself. That disguised the unit’s far larger firepower, obtained through loans of cash and publicly traded securities from SoftBank’s vast balance sheet.  

The rapid rise and fall of Northstar has added to longstanding corporate governance concerns at SoftBank over the company’s ability to place adequate checks on its billionaire founder Son.  

Son holds a third of the unit personally and was the driving force behind its outsized derivative bets on US technology stocks that stunned the market in 2020. In September of that year, the Financial Times unmasked SoftBank as the “Nasdaq whale” that had bought billions of dollars’ worth of US equity derivatives, which other traders blamed for exacerbating big swings in the prices of technology stocks.   


Son disclosed last year that his holding in Northstar had personally cost him about $1.5bn, a figure that will have increased given the further losses incurred unwinding its portfolio.  

One of the people familiar with Northstar said it was unclear when the 64-year old SoftBank founder would cover these personal losses.  

“When is SoftBank going to collect the money? It’s an IOU,” he said.  

Northstar’s remaining positions include British retailer THG and Norwegian e-learning platform Kahoot, which both have SoftBank executive Andreas Hansson on their boards. Hansson is due to leave the group at the end of April, however, according to people familiar with the matter.  

THG’s share price is down 85 per cent since SoftBank purchased $730mn of its shares last May. The formerly hyped British online retailer’s stock price slide has turned into one of the London stock market’s highest-profile fiascos in years. The collapse in value means SoftBank is unlikely to exercise an option to invest $1.6bn in THG’s Ingenuity subsidiary.  

When Son revealed the staggering level of personal losses accrued through Northstar late last year, he admitted making bets on himself was “tough”, but added that he remained undeterred, with the company revealing his investments in SoftBank’s Latin American funds.  

“I am going to take risk again,” Son said at the time.

If you're a bull, tell me why I'm wrong. I'd love to see your side of the market.

*edit* I'll write up a post about why I made this trade in a few hours.

*Here's the write-up*

Most of this is going to be about my macro-economic view of the market. To start off, we have the highest level of margin debt since 1950 (and possibly since the 1929 crash, but I don't have data on that). We have more money (and debt!) in the market than we did in 2000, and than in 08. There's a market frenzy, people who shouldn't be in the market are in the market (our version of 1929 shoe-shine boys, this I have seen with my own eyes), we have insane valuations, and all because people are caught up in ""stocks only go up"".

People are borrowing record levels of money to throw into the market. When it starts to come down, people are going to panic and pull out. You're going to see tons of margin calls, forced selling of positions to cover margin, and it's likely to be one of the greatest wealth transfers in our history.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL663067003Q

The general market is basically just all tech, that's all that is propping it up. Tech is still sitting at insane levels, esp with meme stocks like Tesla. You can try to justify it all you want, and you've heard this before, but there's no logical reason for Tesla to be worth 900B. That's multiples more than Ford, Toyota, Honda, BMW, and GM combined, with less cars sold, and with easily reproducible tech. It doesn't take very long to slap an electric motor and batteries together, look at how fast the other car companies spat out EVs. The stock market is riding on hype. There's nothing about this economy that's better off than how it was pre-covid. We're at record high inflation, overvalued stock and housing markets, a fucked up supply chain 2 years later after the beginning of Covid, and yet the market sits much higher than what was fair value pre-covid.

People say covid only caused 30% crash, but I counter that without Jpow and his printer, we would've fallen even more. Since the Covid crash, we've printed an additional 40% of the pre-covid money supply, see 2020 January. 

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WM2NS

The Fed basically has no credibility. In printing an additional 40% of the pre-covid money supply, the Fed has repeatedly, in 2020, stated that inflation would not be a problem. When inflation started to become a problem and crossed their 2% threshold, they mentioned it was going to be transitory and over with in a couple months. When it turned out inflation was not going to be transitory, they said they were going to start tapering in December and end the taper in June. And just one month into the taper (near December end), the Fed revised their timeline and doubled the speed of their taper so that it would end in March. 

I don't believe Jpow is dumb enough to think printing 40% of the exising money supply would not have inflationary effects on the economy. It's my belief that he's appeasing the market as best he can, using the lowest numbers he can get away with, hence ""inflation is transitory"". Current CPI says we're at 7.9%, I believe we're worse than that. For many of you, that CPI doesn't reflect your true cost increases, and that is what matters most. The Fed can spin the basket and calculations and numbers any way they want, but it can't falsify the real cost of inflation eating away at the general public. They've repeatedly gone back on their words, and it's why I don't trust the current rate increase of 0.25% is going to solve anything. Sooner or later, they will have to raise it much higher and much sooner than what they've been feeding the market. And let me remind you of the general rule of thumb that retail price is about 4x the cost of production. In general, if a factory spends an extra $1 in producing, you'll end up paying an extra $4.

I am likely wrong about the time-frame for the crash, but I have no doubt it is going to happen. Within 3 months? Maybe, maybe not. What I am almost sure of is another big spike in volatility within that time frame. This year is the year the Fed decides what they're going to do with the market, and it's likely to continue to be volatile. Are they going to do their job and protect the value of the US dollar, or keep the market inflated? And no, I'm not betting on a nuclear war.


I'm not into TA, but I thought some of you would find it interesting.

1135,Aftermath of the FED FOMC March 16 ( Quarter Basis Point Hike) & The Risks of 2022.,Discussion,"Respected Traders,

Hope you all had a fantastic weekend.

&#x200B;

I have to say wow, what a pump that was. Nasdaq, Russell, Dow Jones and S&P500, all rallied to more than 3% before FOMC. Surely you weren't worried, because I clearly mentioned all of this in my last post, that after March 16 we would get our exit liq rally. The real reason being trillions of dollars of hedged puts getting closed. Add triple witching closes on top of that.

( Sell the rumor. Buy the news )

&#x200B;

[Everything is just fine.](https://preview.redd.it/hr6mq30j9io81.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=841553062af124407e12d1ffa46932fcbae70014)

&#x200B;

March 16 Meeting. (Summary)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We had a few hiccups when we saw the GDP no in the range b/w 2-3 and the FED funds rate for 2022 to 1.9. What that meant was 0.25X7 = 1.75% hike in 2022 + room for a 50 basis pt hike.

&#x200B;

I have to say I was shocked, but then my boi J. Powell came in to the rescue. He was just not having it to see his and other senators portfolios go into red. Why would he ? They all bought calls for Q2 / Q3  2022. He was pretty adamant that the FED was in control of inflation. That guy talked me down like low GDP, no isn't that big of a deal considering we were coming out of a pandemic. He also assured me that balance sheet run-off was no such a big deal. What's getting a few trillions out of 28T of balance sheet.

&#x200B;

I have to say it, guys. Powell has switched from ""Inflation is Transitory"" to ""Our Economy is very strong with tight labor market"".

Note : Guys don't forget Bullard and Waller are down for 50bps and Balance sheet runoff. Lets see next week with other speakers.

&#x200B;

Aftermath of two camps

&#x200B;

[Camp A vs Camp B](https://preview.redd.it/kmq8hd2gsjo81.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a351864de2f54537f423a87f3710152dcbcb1659)

&#x200B;

We have now got ourselves into two situations :

Camp A) Either Powell has done things right by raising 0.25bps and he is not gonna rug pull us and be transparent about everything, so guys 

"" You can buy this dip ""

Camp B) Powell cannot bring this situation under control and then he will one day at one such meeting come out by surprising me (most probably September 2022) and sending my portfolio into recession territory that inflation can only be tamed by Paul Volckering us. So guys, you can chill out and spend time with friends and family. And later in Q4 you see signs of rug pulling, you can 

"" Short the market in Q4"" and then buy at -50%+ from ATH.

Or

""You can buy this dip, sell before september, short the market , and invest profits in -50% from ATH""

&#x200B;

So choose the camp you guys want. But i am not joining any such teams. Rather, i am looking at things from diff perspective ( i.e. THE BOND MARKET)

&#x200B;

[5 - 10 curves have been inverted. Q4 crisis ?](https://preview.redd.it/nc3vr5pwujo81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec7722287848818eb2ae7a23ef9ddc516276173)

&#x200B;

       What if J Powell made a policy error and we shouldn't have increased rates.
    
    Yes guys, you heard it first here. What if he made such error or he could just be bluffing about going on with an additional 6 rate hikes. Idk about you guys, but i am not feeling too optimistic about more than 4 rate hikes. The Curve is suggesting there is no room for another hike. Do it and you get an inverted curve (10 -2 yield curve) with banks giving chill statements like nothing happens when a curve inverts. 
    
    Also long term bond will sell off and since we are in +ve correlation with curve flateening even before mid cycle of rate hike then it means stock markets will drop with each rate hike increase. Add housing and mortage crisis on top of that. 
    
    
    
    J Powell wasn't too concerned about this in his FOMC remarks. But I am coz Powell lied to me about inflation, but curve hasn't till now. It could have been if Russian money was controlling it. But then we can also assume that the whole stock market is being manipulated.
    
    So it all depends on the data that will be coming out this year. Or powell could inject QE+ after 4 rate hike and once again skip recession by kicking the can down the road if inflation comes down by september.
    

So now that I have established my camp, and where I stand on this.  In no way means it means i am right 100%. It just means I have to sit tight and assess this situation by May 2022. My assumptions could be wrong and hence i will then have to switch to camp A or B. And i will take camp B all day coz i have been supporting it.

&#x200B;

What they know, that we dont know

So campers of the B ( which most of my readers will be coz, i told you to ride exit liq or not and come back in q4 )  i am giving you a HW like any other senior manager of a hedge fund pass-on to their juniors.  

&#x200B;

But i am not that kind of guy. In fact, in the next post ( 2-3 weeks ) we shall have a great discussion where you throw punches at me, and I will land some right back at you. So come prepared.

&#x200B;

Here are a few points you need to research.

&#x200B;

1) Is Russia going for a capture fest in Europe after Ukraine?

2) China abandoning Dollar system with Arab, Pak, India, Russia. Basically division of the world into Asia and EU + USA

3) China invades Taiwan and the battle for Sillicon chips. ( The next war would be fought with chips, not carriers )

4) Sovereign debt crisis. Debt/ GDP ( Start with Greece and then study current Russia and then USA bonds ) 

5) Financial Crisis. Find out which bank in Europe/USA is getting into default. ( Study Credit Suisse )

6) Gold Vs Equity ( My calculation says near dotcom )

7) Recession , Forgotten Depression, The Greater Depression.

8) Study investing in China and Hong Kong stock markets. 

9) Agricultural and Water Investing. 

10) Covid new variant

&#x200B;

Some other points you could cover were reported by Bloomberg. Its like ecom syallabus for yr 2022.

**TLDR:** Yes.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7qm7s/blackrock_crisis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t82pod/blackrock_crisis_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tbwd2h/blackrock_crisis_part_3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Oh Blackrock, you big beautiful fucked bastard, I am so excited to buy up all your shit with the money I make on you on the way down. 

**Quick summary of 1-3:** 

Blackrock is a equity holding giant, the vast majority of their revenue comes from that little MER section at the bottom of the ETF description that you idiots never read. They hold 40% of their crappy overvalued holdings internationally and a boat load of that is worthless Chinese equities and properties. Blackrock owns the world and the world is overvalued. How is China looking since my last post? Not so good huh? A bit of a relief rally during last week's quad witch party was nice for some BABA holding degens, but lets be clear... China is fucked. Since my last post we have seen new lockdowns and a 2008 style sell off as a result. Granted it was gobbled up when the CCP announced they were going full JPOW but we'll see how that goes.  

All in all Blackrock has been bleeding out for months and as you can see in part 2 I circled this week as a nice little buying opportunity for you guys. I sold some of my April puts around $680, and just went all the way back in gorilla style today for May dated OTM puts. 

This week we're talking about **BONDS:**

The bond market is rattled at the fed for raising rates too slowly. Last time we talked about how the mortgage rate was moving independently from the real rates, time to look at those pesky yields. Blackrock like another asset manager works with leverage, therefore they have to paying off debt on the majority of their holdings. As yields increase the payments to service that debt increases and with the majority of its revenue coming from that tasty MER or a percentage of their investment holdings their ability to service that debt is dropping and will drop much further as equities and assets continue to correct. Take a look at what the 10 yr is up to recently:  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s6ckgqnp2so81.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=369fcd2bd283766ca0e29fc7a88e7c8e374895c0

Good luck paying off that debt during the upcoming recession. Oh and if oil ripping up 50% wasn't a good enough recession indicator how about **the yield curve**. If you've never heard of anything before you won't know that yields are supposed to go up the longer the maturation period. i.e. 1<2<5<10<20<30 At the time of writing this Bond yields are:

2yr: 2.107%

5yr: 2.312%

10yr: 2.299%

20yr: 2.647

30yr: 2.523

So far the 5 and the 10 are inverted as well as the 20 and the 30. The classic ones to watch though are the **2 and the 10**, so lets check those out:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bn4gzjb73so81.png?width=1843&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a81d8b375f6d04389e0de148a2c383a9156c875

Oof... Give it a week or two and we'll see the inversion.

Last little chart to take a peak at even for dummy bulls who think we're back on easy mode. Here is **BLK and SPY from 2018.** You can see even though spy had a bit of a rally before the bid dump at the end of the year, BLK was pretty much a steady blead all year.

**TLDR:** Buckle up. we're dumping.

**Positions:** INB4 yeah last week was ass, but sold the last of my other positions in my gambling portfolio and dumped them in to buy the put dip.

1153,AAPL is now less than 5% off of its highs,Company Discussion,"I guess I'm just interested in hearing from those who are bullish on AAPL at its current price, because I find this hard to understand.

AAPL is now trading a 29 PE which is really high given they're growing slower than the other mega cap tech names, and until very recently would trade with a PE in the mid teens. On the other hand AAPL has a solid balance sheet and they continue to return profits to shareholders via buybacks. I can understand why investors might want to own a company like AAPL given the economic uncertainties, but I'm not sure it's worth a 29 PE multiple. It looks like a stock that should trade with a PE multiple in the low 20s to me.

A lot has changed since AAPL last traded at this level. To name a few: RU invaded UA. The 10 year yield is almost percentage point higher. Europe looks likely to enter recession. Gas prices and other commodity prices have spiked higher. Inflation appears to be more persistant than originally thought. And the FED will likely need to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated.

Given economic conditions have deteriorated since, what's the reasoning for AAPL to be trading near ATHs again? Have the fundamentals of the business improved so much that it offsets the heightened economic risks? I genuinely don't understand what's so attractive about this stock.",tn3462,207,185,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tn3462/aapl_is_now_less_than_5_off_of_its_highs/
1154,Do you guys watch the Bond Yields?,,"Before you invest, are you making sure your watching bond yields ?

The first  thing I  learned when working on wall street was to watch bond yields. As yields go up, stocks go down, as yields go down stocks go up.

In 2020, 2021 Yields have for the most part gone down. In 2022 however they will likely only go up (given the fed doesn't back down).

Compared to **JUST 6 MONTHS AGO**, Bonds are up:

US 2Yr up 690%

US 5yr up 204%

US 10yr up 64%

US 30 yr up 31%

This rate of increase is unprecedented. (because rates are moving from the lowest lows, to higher) For reference, the debt crisis that caused 2008 was, among other things, caused by a 30% increase in the US 10yr (from 3.9 to 5.1). Also want to mention that this yield increase happened over the course of 1.5 years, not a few months like we're seeing today.

Example, the monthly payment for a $300,000.00 mortgage loan in the past 6 months has gone from $1,292 (figured 3.1%) to $1,626 (figured 5%).

AKA our economy is grinding to a halt.

I'm hoping to start a discussion, what do you think? What are you doing with your money? When does the system crack, is it within the next few months since were rising so fast, or will this take another year or two to play out?

&amp;#x200B;

\-I've been shorting bonds, TTT &amp; TYO since October of last year.

1164,What's a semi-accurate best guess on what parties are responsible (and at what % of volume) for the roughly 1-2b shares of SPY traded monthly on average?,,"Obviously we will never know EXACTLY who/what traded every share.

But I'm curious if we have any data available to us that can help us understand the markets better.

BlackRock has IVV, Vanguard has VOO. From what I can tell, SPY is managed by State Street Global Advisors.

I know the options chain is obviously part of a certain % of volume (probably a small one) because puts/calls getting exercised will always trigger shares trading hands... right? I can only imagine the complexity of the SPY options chain and won't pretend to understand even a fraction of it. The only question I have is... is it responsible for 90m shares trading a day alone? Probably a not.

I don't think a lot of 401ks or pensions or any other retirement accounts where average Americans dollar-cost-average a portion of their paycheck income/savings end up in SPY. That takes out ""institutional investing"" into SPY, right? If not... what institutions are buying SPY? What product are they offering on top of it, and to who? How large are they? Why wouldn't their customers just buy SPY themselves?

I don't think retail traders/retail day traders/retail swing traders/anything retail are a huge % of the market when speaking about a daily volume perspective. I don't know how big the retail trading market is (on a daily or weekly or monthly scale) but I'd love to learn more. I'm going to guess it's 5-20% of daily volume, being extremely generous. I agree that it's asinine to even think retail is responsible for 20% of daily volume but... I literally can't even estimate/guess/come up with a hypothesis on where the other 95% of the daily volume from SPY comes from. 

Do other asset management companies (who aren't big enough to have their own S&P ETF offerings) charge their clients a fee to put their money in SPY for them behind the scenes, and they are daily rebalancing? Is that where some of the volume comes from?

I know a lot of algorithms are fighting each other for fractions of a penny all day at rapid speed, shaving nanoseconds off and frontrunning buy/sell orders from Robinhood (and others) to make money at scale. But... they can't just trade in between each other all day, can they? Like... there are only so many Robinhood buyers, and all of their volume isn't going to SPY... If ""market makers"" are behind the majority of volume because they are providing liquidity, who are the buyers and sellers on each side? We already determined the majority is not retail, not institutions since they would be targeting mutual funds instead of the ETF.

The market is open from 9:30am -> 4:00pm (6.5 hours, 23.4k seconds). If you ignore pre-market and after-hours (not sure what % of daily volume these two trading windows are responsible for, I'm going to guess less than 10%), you're talking about roughly 2b shares traded in a 21 day window, roughly 95.2m shares per day, just over 4,070 shares a second. What parties are buying and selling 4k shares a second every second of every trading day on average for the entire year on average?

> According to a 2017 JPMorgan analysis, passive investors like ETFs and quantitative investment accounts, which utilize high-frequency algorithmic trading, were responsible for about 60 percent of overall trading volumes while ""fundamental discretionary traders"" (or traders who evaluate the fundamental factors affecting a stock before making an investment) comprised only 10 percent of the overall figures.

1195,Barclays to Book $591 Million Loss Due to Debt-Sale Snafu,,"
Barclays PLC said it is buying back a slug of structured notes at a loss of about £450 million, or $591 million, after selling too many of them. 

Structured notes are a type of debt instrument that is linked to an underlying reference such as the S&P 500 or oil. The British bank had registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell up to $20.8 billion of these notes. It exceeded the limit by $15.2 billion, the company said. 

Barclays said it is conducting a review of the matter. Regulators, too, are “conducting inquiries and making requests for information,” the bank said. As a result, the bank will delay the start of its £1 billion share-buyback program to the second quarter. 

Barclays shares fell 3.6% on Monday, their biggest drop in weeks. 

Expensive flubs are rare in the world of banking, which is built upon a web of technology, policies and procedures designed to nearly eliminate the risk of human error. But mistakes happen. Citigroup Inc. in 2020 accidentally sent $900 million to creditors of cosmetics company Revlon Inc. Last year, the U.K. arm of Banco Santander SA mistakenly paid out £130 million into thousands of random accounts. 

Barclays is known for its large fixed-income business, so the mistake is especially surprising. Analysts and investors struggled to make sense of the announcement. 

“I’ve seen a lot of structured note issuance but I’ve never seen this kind of matter before,” said Joseph Dickerson, an equity research analyst at Jefferies. 

“It looks like an operational or legal failure,” said Jerome Legras, managing partner at Axiom Alternative Investments, a fund that specializes in bank debt. “It’s hard to believe they would do such a stupid thing. This honestly is the first time I’ve heard of something like this.”

Barclays will have to buy the notes at the original purchase price. The estimated loss indicates that a substantial amount of the notes are currently trading below what investors paid for them. In fact, Barclays is more underwater on the notes than it appears: The bank’s calculation includes tax breaks associated with the loss.

Barclays’s iPath Pure Beta Crude Oil ETNs maturing in 2041 and iPath Series B S&P 500 Vix Short-Term Futures ETNs due in 2048 are among the affected notes. The bank stopped selling and issuing new notes a few weeks ago, saying it didn’t have the capacity to do so. They are still trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Barclays breached the limits of what is known as a shelf registration, which is put in place so an issuer can parcel out the sale of a chunk of bonds without seeking regulatory approval each time. The limit is typically outlined ahead of time in the bond prospectus and can be extended. 

“In this case, it looks like they forgot to extend this limit,” Mr. Legras said. 

Barclays said the loss will dent its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key metric of financial health, but it is expected to remain within the bank’s target range of 13% to 14% on March 31.

1197,AT&T Announces Details for Completion of WM Spin-Off,,"How do you all think this will affect the price of AT&T stock after the spin off? I've read some predictions of a $3-4 drop after the spin-off.

https://about.att.com/story/2022/details-for-completion-of-warnermedia-spinoff.html

DALLAS, March 25, 2022 — Today AT&T Inc.* (NYSE:T) announced that it has declared a stock dividend to effect the spin-off of 100% of AT&T’s interest in WarnerMedia to AT&T’s shareholders. The record date for the stock dividend is the close of business on April 5, 2022. This stock dividend is in connection with the previously announced transaction to combine AT&T’s WarnerMedia business with Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: DISCA, DISCB, DISCK). On the closing date of the transaction, anticipated to be in April, AT&T shareholders will receive, on a tax-free basis, an estimated 0.24 shares of stock in Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (WBD) for each share of AT&T common stock. 

AT&T shareholders as of the stock dividend record date will be entitled to receive shares of WarnerMedia Spinco common stock, representing 100% of AT&T’s interest in WarnerMedia. Immediately following this spin-off, the WarnerMedia Spinco shares will be exchanged for stock representing approximately 71% of the new WBD on a fully diluted basis. The exact number of shares of WBD common stock to be received by AT&T shareholders for each AT&T common share will be determined immediately before the closing based on the number of shares of AT&T common stock outstanding and the number of shares of Discovery common stock outstanding on an as‑converted and as‑exercised basis.

AT&T shareholders do not need to take any action. Their WarnerMedia Spinco shares will automatically be exchanged for WBD common stock in the merger, which will occur on the closing date of the transaction. Following close of the transaction, AT&T shareholders will continue to hold, along with their new shares of WBD common stock, the same number of shares of AT&T common stock they held immediately prior to close. After close, investors should expect that AT&T’s share price will adjust to reflect the transfer of the WarnerMedia business to the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery entity.

Factors that May Affect the Timing of the Spin-Off

The timing of the spin-off is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions for the transaction. If certain closing conditions are not satisfied or waived in advance of April 5, AT&T may elect to change the stock dividend record date to a later date.

AT&T Declares Dividends on Common and Preferred Stock

With the close of the pending WarnerMedia transaction expected in April, the AT&T board of directors today also declared a second quarter dividend of $0.2775 per share on the company’s common stock. While future dividends remain subject to board approval, this amount is consistent with AT&T’s previous announcement that the board had approved an expected post-close annual common dividend of $1.11 per share. At the updated rate, AT&T’s stock remains among the best dividend-yielding stocks in the United States and in the Fortune 500.

Additionally, the board of directors declared quarterly dividends on the company’s 5.000% Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, and the company’s 4.750% Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C. The Series A dividend is $312.50 per preferred share, or $0.3125 per depositary share. The Series C dividend is $296.875 per preferred share, or $0.296875 per depositary share.

Dividends on the common stock and Series A and Series C preferred stock are payable on May 2, 2022, to shareholders of record of the respective shares at the close of business on April 14, 2022.

The board of directors also declared an annual dividend on the company’s Fixed Rate Reset Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, of €2,875.00 per preferred share. Dividends on the Series B preferred stock are payable on May 3, 2022, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 14, 2022.

Two-Way Trading for AT&T Stock Expected to Begin on April 4

AT&T has been advised by the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) that beginning on the trading day immediately prior to the April 5 record date for the spin-off distribution (currently April 4) and continuing through the close of trading on the business day before the closing date of the merger,1 there will be two markets in AT&T common stock on the NYSE: a ""regular way"" market and an ""ex-distribution"" market. During this period of two-way trading in AT&T common stock, there will also be a market on the Nasdaq for WBD common stock on a “when issued” (“WI”) basis.

The trading options that will be available during the two-way trading period are:

AT&T Regular Way Trading
If, during the period of two-way trading, an AT&T shareholder sells a share of AT&T common stock in the regular way market under AT&T's NYSE symbol, ""T,"" the shareholder will be selling both the share of AT&T common stock and the right to receive shares of WBD common stock in the transaction.

AT&T Ex-distribution Trading
If, during the period of two-way trading, an AT&T shareholder sells a share of AT&T common stock in the ex-distribution market under the temporary NYSE symbol ""T WI,"" the AT&T shareholder will be selling only a share of AT&T common stock and will retain the right to receive shares of WBD common stock in the transaction.

WBDWV Trading
During the two-way trading period, an AT&T shareholder also has the option of selling the right to receive shares of WBD common stock while retaining shares of AT&T common stock. This option will be available under the temporary Nasdaq symbol ""WBDWV"".

Trades under the symbols ""T WI"" and ""WBDWV"" will settle after the closing date of the WarnerMedia-Discovery transaction. If the transaction is not completed, all trades made under these temporary symbols will be cancelled.

In all cases, investors should consult with their financial and tax advisors regarding the specific implications of selling shares of their AT&T common stock or the right to receive shares of WBD common stock on or before the closing date of the WarnerMedia-Discovery transaction.",trzp4j,181,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/trzp4j/att_announces_details_for_completion_of_wm_spinoff/

1210,SoFi company analysis and valuation - Big story and many risks ($SOFI),Company Analysis,"SoFi has been a very popular retail stock and I underestimated the amount of information that was available for it. It took me quite some time to differentiate what is important and what isn't and this post is a summary of my findings and it includes valuation at the very end.

**What is SoFi?**

SoFi is a Fintech company that aspires to be a one-stop-shop for financial services, that allows members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money.

Now, the main question is, well, **how is this different than a bank?** The management provides 4 differentiation points:

1. Speed - being faster than the competitors when it comes to approval of loans, opening accounts, buying/selling stock through their platform, payments, etc. - In my opinion, although this industry has been around for hundreds of years, there's no doubt that certain parts of it have to be disrupted. However, my question is, assuming this is an advantage that SoFi has, is it sustainable for the next 5, 10, or 15 years? I don't think so.

2. Selection of products - More products related to borrowing, saving, investing, and protecting money. I personally don't buy this differentiation point. I do believe cost-cutting is possible, but coming up with something new and innovative that's significantly different than the current offerings, I doubt it.

3. Content - Financial education, research, insights - Even if SoFi has a platform that offers more financial education and research, this is something that is easily replicable. I don't see this as a huge long-term advantage.

4. Convenience - Instead of having opening times between 9 and 5 from Monday to Friday, they want to offer the services 24/7. The company has an only online presence so they can cut some costs as they don't have to lease buildings for this purpose.

&#x200B;

**The 3 segments**

The company has 3 segments and it is worth spending time understanding each one:

1. The lending segment - self-explanatory - accounts for 75% of the total revenue
2. The technology segment - which is related to Galileo - accounts for 19% of the total revenue
3. The financial services segment - is related to all the products such as debit/credit cards, budgeting tools, investing, etc. - accounts for 6% of the total revenue

All 3 sectors have been growing fast, but we need more information to understand the second one.

The technology segment is related to an acquisition the company made back in 2020 (Galileo) and the purchase price was roughly $1.2b. At the time, that was almost 15% of the company's market cap. What SoFi got from the acquisition was a payment processing platform that uses AI for fraud detection, which is more efficient than the industry average. On top of that, it has an API that allows for app development. The revenue for SoFi will come in the form of platform fees and program management fees. This is one of their big bets and the management refers to this segment as the AWS of Fintech. The same way a business can be started on Amazon within a day, well, that's what they're aiming for, except for companies in the financial industry.

&#x200B;

**The growth story, the metrics, and the confusion**

The company provides two key metrics for its growth in its annual report.

1. The # of users - This has significantly grown from 1m back in 2019, to almost 2m in 2020 to almost 3.5m in 2021. However, it is worth mentioning that every one that is registered on the platform is a member and remains one unless the terms of service are violated. So, if there's an inactive member for 3 years, it doesn't matter, that person will be considered a member. However, what I'm missing here is the revenue per user. Having users is good, but if they're not being monetized, the metric is useless.
2. The # of products - If the first metric is not that useful, maybe this one serves a better job. If you as a member have a personal loan, well, that's one product. If you have a credit card, that's another one. If you are using their platform to invest, that's another one. The idea of the company to build a good relationship with its members and sell many of its products is great. Well, the number of products reported in 2021 was 5m. That translates to roughly 1.5 products per person. It did increase from 1.21 in 2019, but it isn't that impressive (yet). Although it sounds as if this could be a great metric, well, there's another trap here, not every product has the same value. 1m of these 5m products are related to the lending segment, which as mentioned above, accounts for 75% of the total revenue! The remaining 4m products bring in only 6% of the revenue as they're related to the financial services.

So, we have metrics that are not that reliable. What's next?

&#x200B;

**The company's performance and what can we expect?**

If we look at the company's performance, it is a money-losing company with a negative net margin of -48% for 2021 on its roughly $1b in revenue.

A **mature** company in this industry has:

\- a net margin that's between 10-15% 

\- high leverage (debt on the balance sheet being over 80% of the total passive)

\- RoE around 16%

Currently, the debt is around 50% of the balance sheet, so there's still a lot of room to grow.

These numbers should serve as a sanity check later on for my valuation as if I forecast anything that's significantly above that, it might be unreasonable.

&#x200B;

**What's next?**

The company made one large acquisition (Galileo) in 2020 for $1.2b. At the beginning of 2022, they announced the large acquisition of Technisys for $1.1b, which is a company that will serve as their core banking system. Both of these acquired companies have some presence in LATAM, so SoFi is acquiring new companies that have a presence in other geographical regions as well.

The analysts forecast about 50% revenue growth in 2022, followed by 41% revenue growth in 2023. Great growth, but slightly declining. At the same time, the net margin is expected to improve, from -48% in 2021, to :

\-21% in 2022

\-6% in 2023

\+5% in 2024

&#x200B;

**The risks**

Due to the actions being taken, there are two large risks that I see:

1. **Execution** risk - Their big bet (The technology segment), currently accounts for less than 20% of the revenue and hasn't yet proven as successful.
2. **Integration** risk - Combining SoFi with Galileo and Technisys might sound great and there's always the amazing word synergy being used, but that's yet to be seen in the financials. There's an integration risk here that needs to be addressed.

&#x200B;

**The valuation**

Taking into account all the information above, I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value.

**Revenue growth** \- 898% in the next 10 years (following analysts' estimates for the next 2 years, then slowly declining). From $1b in 2020 to $10b in 2030.

**Net margin** \- From -48% in 2021 to 13.5% in 2030 - Close to industry average

**Discount rate** \- 12.8% (Based on cost of equity)

**RoE** \- Based on the assumptions above and the development of equity, the RoE is roughly 15%, which is close to the industry's average.

&#x200B;

Putting all the numbers together, and adjusting for the equity options and the preferred shares, the value of the company is **$8.8b** (almost $8/share). The current market cap is $6.5b.

It is worth mentioning that at the moment, I am looking at SoFi as a company that's not significantly different than the current ones in this industry.  I am aware that I could be significantly wrong in my assumptions and if I see a better performance from their technology segment, my storyline would significantly change.

I'd like to get your view on the company and I am sure there are plenty of pieces in this puzzle that I have to learn more about.",u02410,158,106,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u02410/sofi_company_analysis_and_valuation_big_story_and/
1211,The current sentiment makes me think stocks might rally,,"I've been in the market during three significant downturns: dot-com (teenager with a custodial Etrade account), 2008 and 2020.  In all cases, the bottom was when people took worst-case scenarios as given.  They all thought it was obvious things would go lower, and even if they were buyers, they prefaced comments with statements like ""I'm just going to keep buying all the way to the bottom.""  No one thought things were about to go up.

Somehow, we're at that point right now.  It is somehow clear to everyone that things are bad and are going to get much, much worse.  That sort of sentiment makes me think we are in for a rally.  When markets have been on the edge of an actual cliff before, the prevailing view was things wouldn't get that bad, valuations weren't too crazy, known risks were less serious than some thought, etc.

My view: The economy is stronger than some people believe, we don't have a recession, oil prices won't go as high as some think and the sell off will be viewed as a buying opportunity in retrospect.  There are still some stocks that I think will fall further (no- or low-earnings tech), but significant parts of the market are not particularly expensive relative to earnings, especially when interest rates are accounted for.

>That's because the funds the country used to make the debt payments came from Russia's frozen foreign assets, sanctioned because of its attack on Ukraine — so it remains unclear whether investors will receive their money.
Anton Siluanov, Russia's finance minister, told state media Russia Today that the country had made good on its obligations to creditors. But the ""possibility or impossibility of fulfilling our obligations in foreign currency does not depend on us,"" Siluanov said, according to RT, warning that the payment might not go through if the United States disallows it.

>""We have the money, we made the payment, now the ball is in America's court,"" he said.
A spokesman for the Treasury said the United States would allow the payments to go through.

1214,Those who are bearish on TSLA what are your main talking points?,Company Discussion,"I personally am very bullish on TSLA and believe that it has a 90% chance of becoming the next biggest company in the world by 2030. From what I see, no company can produce EVs as cheaply, as high quality and as many as Tesla (not even Chinese EVs). They have the trifecta of manufacturing and EVs are still in the early adoption phase. Legacy auto makers have stagnant evaluations for the last decade.

Tesla is also the current leader in FSD technology, although it has a long way to go, growth in AI is exponential and we will get there eventually within a reasonable time frame. Tesla is going to be more of a robotaxi company than a car company. The economic gain of robotaxis is going to be insane, cars sit idle 95% of the time any decent economist will tell you that is money being lit on fire. If they can reduce that to just 70% idle, it will result in at least a trillion saved by not requiring a driver, increased speed of traffic, reduced accidents, and most importantly (in US and Canada) not being financially burdened by owning a car just to name a few.

It is more correct to say a Tesla revolution than an EV revolution. I did my research on TSLA back in mid 2021 and I strongly believe that today, in terms of information available and TSLA financials, is the best time to invest because there is very little uncertainty.

She is a medical student currently and won't be touching that money for the next 3.5 years due to her being in school; she was planning to use part of that money for a down payment for a house when she finishes school.

Her account consists of 70k, with 60k being in cash, I urged her to talk to her financial advisor to figure out why 60k is being left in cash as with rising inflation rates, as it will just lose value over the years. She talked to her financial advisors, and they stated that the market is volatile currently and isn't a smart move to invest all the cash, as she is very risk-averse.  They even stated that putting that money into bonds isn't the correct decision either.

I'm not a financial advisor, but I'm confused, isn't it better to put your money into VOO/VTI and Bonds if you aren't going to be touching your cash for the next 3.5 years? It seems like just sitting on 60k to devalue over the upcoming years isn't the smartest financial decision?

&#x200B;

\> Three investors are suing Vanguard Group for alleged negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, saying that changes the company made to target date retirement funds resulted in “massive tax bills” for individual investors. 

\> The asset manage ... had two tiers of target date funds, one for individual investors and retirement plans with fewer than $5 million and one for institutional investors with more than $100 million, according to the lawsuit. 

\> In December 2020, Vanguard lowered its minimum for institutional investors to $5 million. 

\> That change sparked a sell-off in the retail target funds as smaller retirement plans sold assets in order to shift money into lower cost institutional funds, according to the lawsuit. Vanguard’s retail funds sold as much as 15% of their assets to raise cash to redeem shares, and in doing so realized capital gains which were distributed to the funds’ remaining investors as required by law, according to the lawsuit. 

\> Vanguard had other options to avoid this outcome such as lowering the retail fund fees for plans that had at least $5 million invested or merging the two funds together, according to the lawsuit. 

\> Ultimately, Vanguard did the latter, merging the funds together in September 2021. This had no tax consequences for investors, according to the lawsuit. “At this point, however, the harm was done. Taxable investors had already incurred unnecessary capital gains distributions—and corresponding taxes—that could not be erased.”",tfked2,138,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tfked2/investors_sue_vanguard_after_target_date_funds/

1229,"Why breaking things is not profitable (wars, destroyed production, repair costs)",Meta,"It has come to my attention that at least some users here don't understand why the broken window fallacy is a fallacy. For those who have been misled into thinking war is somehow good for the economy it is time to take a reading field trip to Investopedia.com

When money and productivity have to be spent to replace things or repair something that should already be working then they are lost. That money is not creating something new or invesing in the future. If that thing that is broken or needs replacement was intentionally damaged then that is a cost and not an investment. 


If suddenly Amazon warehouses spontaneously ignite and need to be repaired that is not a benefit to AMZN nor the American economy nor the world economy. If someone went around destroying delivery trucks around AMZN distribution centers that would not be creating jobs for the economy and would not be adding to anyone or anything it would be reducing overall productivity. Instead of AMZN expanding distribution it is delayed while trying to fix what it **already had**.


*The broken window fallacy argues that there is no economic gain from fixing the destruction caused by a certain event. Even though capital will be spent to repair any damages, that is only a maintenance cost that does not spur the economy in the long run, as it is not a true increase in economic output. The money and time spent on repairing damages could be spent on more productive goods and services. In war, resources are diverted to creating weapons as opposed to using those resources to invest in areas that could increase actual economic output.*

1231,Stock Traders Brace for a $3.5 Trillion ‘Triple Witching’ Event Friday March 18,News," 

In a quarterly event known as triple witching, roughly $3.5 trillion of single-stock and index-level options are set to expire, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. At the same time, more near-the-money options are maturing than at any time since 2019 -- suggesting a bevy of investors will actively trade around those positions.

And once [again](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/triple-witching-to-hit-market-where-traders-pay-up-for-hedges), this triple witching coincides with a rebalancing of benchmark indexes including the S&P 500 -- a combination that tends to spark single-day volumes that rank among the highest of the year. According to an estimate from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the rebalance in the index alone could spur $33 billion of stock trades.

Friday’s session lands just as the S&P 500 regains its [footing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/stocks-aided-by-upbeat-powell-bonds-flash-caution-markets-wrap) with a three-day jump, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s optimism the economy can withstand rate hikes and China’s promise to bolster its financial markets. Yet in the telling of derivatives pros, the rally has been fueled by dealers covering short positions to balance exposures while demand for stock hedges is elevated.

Now as many contracts expire, the key question is whether investors will rebuild their holdings of protective puts amid growth concerns and the war in Ukraine -- or will they chase the market rebound with call contracts.

1237,"Panasonic is supposedly an undervalued stock that could grow massively the next 5 years, what do you think?",,"I just read an article in a local danish investment magazine that predicted Panasonic to grow massively the next 5 years. Reason is:

1. Panasonic is massively undervalued as is. While most other tech stocks are growing Panasonic has been forgotten and hasn't really grown at all. This is despite them being one of the biggest EV battery manufactures. They make the batteries for Tesla. This is largely due to them being seen as another Japanese tech company that operates in a ton of boring markets and make largely unexciting products. While this has been true in the past it might not be the case in the future:

2. The company has just started a full restructuring. Instead of being in around 50 different markets (try going to their website), they plan to reduce to being in 15-20 markets that have growth potential (such as EV batteries). They also have new senior management and are planning to restructure the company into a ""western"" style holding company with different sub-companies (such as Google and Facebook has done with their Alphabet and Meta restructuring and rebranding). This gives them more options for starting new ventures and selling/spinning off other branches that do not benefit the group. This also allows them to separate their consumer and industry products more. They make everything from electric razors, to batteries, and to industrial automation under the same brand currently. With the restructuring these different products will be more clearly managed under different companies and brands.

1248,Aercap’s (AER) 3.5b loss of aircraft to Russia could pop the “aircraft leasing bubble”:,Company Analysis,"Aercap, the world’s largest aircraft leasing company, has submitted an insurance claim for 3.5 billion worth of aircraft and engines that Russia refuses to return.

However, even if they do get the entire insurance claim (unlikely as the claim is going to be fought in court, Loyds of London suggests they should get 10 to 15% https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2022/03/30/660380.htm ) this loss is about much more than the assets/planes themselves.

It reflects a change in how Aercap will be able to do business.

Aercap acts as a “middleman” between investors who offer capital to buy aircraft, aircraft manufacturers, and airlines. However, their unprecedented loss almost certainly means an end of the cheap debt and cheap insurance payments they rely on. 

Aircraft leasing is relatively new over the past 40 years. The number of commercial aircrafts that are leased from a leasing company has grown from 1.7% to 51% of total aircrafts ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095749/share-leased-aircraft-aviation-industry-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095749/share-leased-aircraft-aviation-industry-worldwide/)). 

The growth of this industry is largely based on the Cape Town Treaty ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape\_Town\_Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town_Treaty)), a treaty where all signatory countries agree that that they will facilitate the repossession of assets like planes, trains, farm equipment etc to the original state.  

By stealing foreign aircrafts, Russia has broken this treaty, showing that leasing aircrafts is much more risky than previously understood. 

Aercap is highly indebted, owing about as much as it owns in assets (74.5 billion in debts, 74.6b in assets *(before the Russian loss)*. They require access to cheap loans in order to facilitate their position as a middleman between bond investors and airlines. They say so themselves: 

“We have incurred a substantial amount of debt to complete the GECAS Transaction, \[most recent 30B bond/loan offering\] which has significantly increased our indebtedness and debt service obligations, increasing risks relating to our substantial level of indebtedness” (2021 q4 earnings FORM 20-F, p 6).

**“**To service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available” (FORM 20-F, p 7). 

“Despite our substantial indebtedness, we might incur significantly more debt” (FORM 20-F, p 7).

At the time of borrowing the 30b, before the Russian loss, the company had a  MSCI ESG Rating of “A.” This was largely because investors bought into the Cape Town Treaty, seeing planes as assets that are really hard to lose. After Russia stealing the planes, the chances of AerCap ever being able to borrow money again at such a cheap price seems unlikely. 

The same is true for their insurance costs, both the type of insurance AER will have to buy (in order to avoid a similar situation now where they have to fight the claims in court) along with the the increase in premiums to reflect the risk means that their overhead will increase significantly. 

All this means a significant increase in overhead costs in an industry that relies on high amounts of debt. It may be untenable for them to continue to borrow enough money cheaply enough to maintain their company.",tx9kf1,108,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tx9kf1/aercaps_aer_35b_loss_of_aircraft_to_russia_could/

1252,Zoom analysis and valuation - The winner of the pandemic is back to reality ($ZM) value $78 vs price $116,Company Analysis,"Zoom's share price went wild from around $70 prior to the pandemic to its all-time high of over $550! What followed after that was a decline of around 80% (Now trading at $116/share).

This post is an attempt to provide some information behind the volatility, the irrational stock price movement as well as to value Zoom as a company, today.

**What is Zoom?**

If I have to describe Zoom in one sentence, that would be ""A company that provides a communication platform"".

Yes, there are different packages that it offers, different features and offerings (Zoom meetings, Phone, Events & Webinar, Rooms, etc), but it all goes back to solving one problem --> How can individuals remain connected and collaborate when physically not close to each other?

**The IPO**

In the case of Zoom, I do believe that going back to April 2019 is important. The IPO is an important event as it allows the company to raise funds from the public so it can continue expanding its operations and also allow the initial investors to exit and make a return on their initial investments.

The determination of the IPO price is not a process that is done within minutes. It takes a lot of time and takes into account a lot of factors, not from a valuation point of view, but also from a pricing standpoint. In the end, the goal of the management (often time with some investment bank) is to figure out, what is the highest price that the public will pay?

The IPO price was set at $36/share. On the first day of trading, it went up to $66/share, almost double. What does this mean? The public was either:

1. Paying a premium and seeing Zoom as a company that's less risky than the average company on the market; or
2. Had higher expectations of Zoom than the management of Zoom (Otherwise they would've set the IPO price at $66/share)

**The financial performance**

The company's revenue grew from $331m in 2018 to:

\- $623m in 2019 (up 88%)

\- $2.7b in 2020 (up 325%)

\- $4.1b in 2021 (up 55%)

This growth is not something that we have seen that often and the pandemic was the main impact of it. However, the forecast for the next year is roughly 10% and that's not surprising.

Every individual/organization that needed Zoom or any other platform of this kind, well, they have become customers. The expansion ahead is very limited and there might be a reversal in terms of the number of customers. Schools for example would not need Zoom as much when everyone goes back there physically.

At the same time, the operating margin expanded from 2% to 26%. 

On one side, their gross margin decreased due to the increased demand. In order to provide the service on short notice, the direct costs for Zoom increased. However, the main increase of the margin came from the reduction of Sales & Marketing costs as a % of the revenue. Back in 2018/2019, Zoom had to spend more (per $ in revenue) to reach potential customers. In 2020/2021, the customers would go to Zoom as they needed such a platform. So, although the Sales and marketing in absolute value increased (from $331m in 2018 to $1.1b in 2021), as a % of the revenue it decreased from 56% to 28%.

**The financial position**

If we take a look at the financial position, Zoom is a dream company for every investor. It has $5.9b in cash, short-term and long-term investments with no debt apart from the $40m capital leases.

The management has been authorized to use $1bn in the next 2 years for share buybacks.

**So, how much is Zoom worth?**

Of course, every valuation has certain assumptions:

**Revenue growth:** 10% in the next 5 years, then slowly decline to the risk-free rate by year 10.

**Operating margin**: To slowly improve to 28% (mainly due to increase in gross margin)

**Discount rate:** 7.93% - based on WACC (assuming a beta of 1)

Putting all of the numbers together, the value/share of Zoom is around $78, much lower than the current market price of $116.

Could be I wrong? Absolutely. Below is a table that calculates the fair value/share based on different assumptions about the revenue of the company in 10 years and the operating margin.

|Revenue / Op. margin|26%|28%|30%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|80% ($7.4b)|$67.6|$71.5|$75.4|
|108% ($8.5b)|$74.0|$78.5|$82.9|
|200% ($12.3b)|$94.5|$100.8|$107.0|
|250% ($140.4b)|$105.6|$112.8|$120.0|

If the company can grow the revenue by 250% (from $4.1b to $14.4b) in the next 10 years and improve the operating margin to 30%, Zoom could be fairly valued. Of course, that offers little to no margin of safety. 

**The market is irrational**

Let's not forget that the share price went all the way up to $550. In order to justify that, the company should've kept growing at 40-50% for the next decade! Is that feasible? I don't think so.

Often times we see price increases that cannot be justified with fundamental reasons, this is definitely one of those times.

1259,Will the Fed raise rates by 50 basis points in May?,Discussion,"The Federal Reserve released the minutes of its monetary policy meeting today. The Fed disclosed details of its plan to shrink its balance sheet. Given that U.S. inflation is at a 40-year high, the market expects the Fed to accelerate the process of shrinking its balance sheet. At the same time, the market will also pay attention to the clues that the Fed will raise interest rates further.

Shrink the table process or speed up

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March FOMC meeting that there would be ""a more detailed discussion"" of the $8.9 trillion balance sheet. At that meeting, the Fed announced its first rate hike since 2018.

Market expectations are that the Fed may shrink its balance sheet faster this time than it did in 2017-2019.

California Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday that the balance sheet reduction process could begin as early as May, and much faster than in 2017. It is reported that during the quantitative tightening period from 2017 to 2019, the Fed began to reduce assets by $10 billion per month, and gradually increased the cap to $50 billion per month after a year.

https://preview.redd.it/t53ykk0xqzr81.jpg?width=838&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f12325e3fbd99d515cd0f222f11c9310dbef250

Fed officials only stopped buying bonds last month as soaring inflation accelerated plans to trim the balance sheet, seen as a passive way to tighten monetary policy in tandem with raising interest rates.

""They're going to have a comprehensive plan,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC. ""They want to be ready to announce it in May. With inflation so high, it's become a pressing issue. .""

Economists say the reduction in the asset cap could amount to $100 billion a month, or about $1 trillion a year. JPMorgan's Michael Feroli estimates the caps for Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at $60 billion and $30 billion respectively, Krishna Guha of evercore ISI expects $50 billion and $30 billion, and Deutsche Bank estimates $50 billion and $30 billion, respectively. $60 billion and $45 billion.

With inflation already at its highest level since 1982, the Fed's tapering is likely to peak relatively quickly.

Aneta Markowska, chief U.S. financial economist at Jefferies LLC, said it could be ""a very short phase, two months, and there's really no need for a long-term phased in.""

There is a high degree of uncertainty about the economic impact of shrinking the balance sheet. Powell said shrinking the balance sheet ""could amount to another rate hike."" The FOMC has committed to using interest rates rather than assets as its primary monetary policy tool.

Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said: ""They do prefer raising rates as their primary tool for tightening. The Fed will make balance sheet adjustments if necessary, but for now wants to focus on rates.""

The asset reduction would be the Fed's latest attempt to ease inflationary pressures. In March, the Fed raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 0.25% to 0.5%. For the past two years, the Fed has kept borrowing costs near zero to insulate the economy from the impact of the outbreak.

&#x200B;

The Fed's dot plot shows officials expect the median benchmark rate to be around 1.9% at the end of 2022 before rising to 2.8% in 2023.

While details of the balance sheet reduction were the focus of the meeting minutes, investors will also be carefully looking for clues on whether the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points in May. Powell said on March 22 that he was willing to raise interest rates further at the May meeting if necessary. Other policymakers have since expressed the same sentiment.

""I think a 50 basis point rate hike will be discussed, with at least 'several' or 'many' players open to raising rates in the coming months,"" Markowska said.",txz2xd,100,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/txz2xd/will_the_fed_raise_rates_by_50_basis_points_in_may/
1260,Elon Musk Says Tesla Aiming At 30% Gross Margin For Supercharger Network,Company News,"CEO **Elon Musk** said on Sunday that the electric vehicle maker is aiming at a 30% gross margin or about 10% profitability including all costs for its **Supercharger** network business.

**What Happened:** Investor Ross Gerber had asked Musk if Tesla works on “a 50% gross margin on the energy cost,” and “if it is across the network or it varies by location?”

**Why It Matters:** Tesla reported overall automotive gross margins of 27% last year and 21% in 2020. The EV maker does not reveal a unit-wise margin breakup.

Tesla owns and operates over 30,000 Superchargers in over 2,564 locations globally, of this over 8,000 Superchargers are in China alone. The Musk-led company has been scaling up its supercharging network amid rising competition.

We can all feel the negative atmosphere in the stock market, since the beginning of the year, we've been hearing nothing but bad news.

Now, let's try to look beyond the near term challenges.

What are your realistic expectations for the stock market in the next 10 years?

Will it be positive return? Negative return? Neutral?

Which sectors will outperform and which will underperform?

My opinion:
I can't think of a scenario where tech will NOT outperform the market. Even if interest rates hit 10% and a world war breaks out, I think tech will still be standing tall and strong.

By Tom Angell


Ahead of a House vote on a federal marijuana legalization bill this week, the Congressional Research Service published a new report looking at how cannabis’s Schedule I status impedes research, makes banking difficult and creates collateral consequences for consumers.

The Pennsylvania Senate Banking & Insurance Committee unanimously approved a marijuana banking bill. It doesn’t provide the federal protections that cannabis businesses want, but the state-level reform adds pressure on Congress to act.

https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-cannabis-bill-amendments-cleared-for-floor-votes-newsletter-march-31-2022/

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) tweeted, “So many Americans live in states where cannabis is legal for adult recreational use. It’s past time for the federal government to catch up. Comprehensive federal cannabis reform with equity for the communities most impacted by the War on Drugs is a Senate priority.”

1273,"Former Treasury Secretary Summers makes another ""doomsday prophecy"": U.S. recession is inevitable",Industry News,"The combination of economic overheating, policy delays, and supply shocks makes a U.S. recession more likely in the coming years. Economists' latest forecasts also show the chance of a recession in the next 12 months has risen to 27.5% from 20% last month

According to former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the United States will fall into a recession next year, and more and more economists are reaching a consensus on this.

On Friday, Summers pointed out on a TV show that the combination of ""overheating, policy delays, and supply shocks"" poses an extremely difficult set of challenges, so that a U.S. recession is ""clearly more difficult than no recession in the next few years."" It is possible,"" adding that economists are gradually reaching such a consensus.

Data from a survey of economists does show that the probability of a recession they forecast in the next 12 months has risen from 20% last month to 27.5% today.

Summers emphasized that historically, the United States has not been without a recession within two years after inflation above 4% and unemployment below 4%. At present, the market's expectation for the US CPI in March has exceeded 8%, and the corresponding unemployment rate is 3.6%.

Summers believes that if the Fed is to reduce inflation, it needs to properly weaken the labor market. He cited nominal wages (not adjusted for cost of living), which he said were surging at the fastest rate on record, with an annual rate of 5.6 per cent in March. And a recent co-authored paper by Summers shows that once nominal wage growth exceeds a certain rate ""say 4% or 4.5%"" it leads to worse, not better, outcomes in terms of household purchasing power.

And right now, in the words of Summers, the U.S.’s current 40-year high inflation means that average real wages last year were “one of the worst performances we’ve ever seen.”

It is worth mentioning that Summers predicted as early as the middle of last year that U.S. inflation would reach 5% by the end of the year, much higher than the Fed’s statement of 3.4% at the time, and the final data also confirmed Summers’ prediction.",u0y4yf,94,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u0y4yf/former_treasury_secretary_summers_makes_another/

Berkshire BRK.A, +0.19% BRK.B, -0.03% disclosed in a late Wednesday filing that it owned 120.95 million shares of HP HPQ, -3.03% after buying shares in recent days. That position is worth about $4.2 billion and represents a roughly 11% stake in the company. The stock rose nearly 10% in after-hours trading.

“HP is committed to one of the largest share-repurchase programs (relative to market cap) within our coverage, so we think Berkshire’s involvement makes sense,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients.

While he said he didn’t believe that Berkshire’s investment in HP would drive significant changes to HP’s business, he deemed the high-profile stake a “validation of HPQ’s strategy/capital return program,” noting that Berkshire began purchasing shares after HP announced plans to purchase the workplace-technologies company Poly for $3.3 billion late last month.

Berkshire’s HP stake indicates that Buffett sees value in HP’s business, though several analysts have sounded cautious lately on the market for personal computers following a pandemic-driven boom.

1289,Inflation and its effect on the stock market,,"While reading a bit on the ideas to protect money from inflation, I noticed many people have the idea to move their money into the  general stockmarket (e.g. indexes, managed-funds, S&P, NASDAQ). The idea behind this is that the money is ""save"" in the market due to companies in general profiting from increasing prices and therefor increasing in value. 

I do not comprehend how this would work, for the following reasons:

1. As long as the stockmarket value does not increase as much as inflation, you still lose value. 
2. As long as salaries do not incease as much as inflation (which currently does not seem the case), this would cause consumers to lose buying power. Anything consumer related thus would start making less profits and drop in value. Any money invested in related stocks would thus lose to inflation and to the stock dropping in value.

Putting your money in indexes/funds might thus work countereffective as you are hit by inflation and the stock market dropping/being stagnant due to consequences of inflation. Looking at the inflationary period from the 1965-83, the S&P was more or less stagnant over this timeframe. You would thus mainly have lost money to >5% y/y inflation in that period in the market (I am not sure how much stocks have paid dividends in those times, that might have compensated for this). Market growth only continued after 1983 (after the insane rate hikes put trough by the FED, putting inflation down). Based on this it, seems that buying the general market is not a good strategy if inflation rages. 

I could not really find individual stock prices of companies that might have performed well in 70/80s (if anyone has a source, I am interested). However, judging from commoditiy prices in the timeframe of 1965 to 1985, oil, gold, iron etc (so basically commodities) would have been great investments over that timeframe. 

Do you guys think picking investments (e.g. commodities/related stocks) might allow you to outrun inflation, are you sticking with a general market DCA strategy or do you have another strategy?",tvc9yg,82,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tvc9yg/inflation_and_its_effect_on_the_stock_market/
1290,U.S. debt slumps Amazon (AMZN.US) is also unable to escape the fate of continued decline,Opinion,"As the Fed continues to release signals of interest rate hikes and balance sheet reductions, which has led investors to re-price risky assets, Amazon ([AMZN.US](https://AMZN.US)) stock price has also been very sluggish. As of Monday's close, the stock closed down 2.16% at $3,022.44. Will Amazon's stock price continue to fall in the future? The answer may be found by analyzing the actual yield.

**Real rate of return**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7oyu897ea3t81.jpg?width=882&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99a05251816c504b32e048f30111439f50b8ef77

As you can see in the chart, as long as you superimpose the chart of Amazon's stock price with that of the Inflation Bond Index ETF ([TIP.US](https://TIP.US)), it's easy to see that the two have been strongly correlated since 2018.

It is understood that the inflation bond index ETF is a basket of inflation-protected bonds. This means that when the inflation bond index ETF is rising, it indicates that real yields are falling; when the ETF is falling, it indicates that real yields are rising.

**Will real interest rates soar?**

The 10-year U.S. inflation-protected bond yield has been negative since the start of 2019, except for a brief turn positive during the market turmoil in March 2020. However, in the past week, the yield has soared rapidly from -0.49% to -0.15%, and it is infinitely close to returning to positive territory. In November, the yield on 10-year U.S. inflation-protected bonds hit a low of -1.26%.

While the extraordinary era of negative real interest rates over the past few years has supported demand for riskier assets, it has also created an unprecedentedly loose financial environment. But now everything could be turned upside down - the Fed desperately needs to raise real interest rates in order to curb inflation.

Market expectations for a hike in the Fed's policy rate have risen sharply. Interest rate futures prices tied to the date of the Fed's meeting now imply that the Fed's policy rate will peak at around 3.15% in mid-2023, well above the current 0.25%-0.5%. Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said on Friday that the Fed may need to raise interest rates well beyond its current forecasts — possibly more than 4%.

Therefore, it is highly likely that real yields will soar, which means that the inflation bond index ETF will continue to fall, and Amazon's stock price will fall further, and the speed of Amazon's stock price decline may depend on the efficiency of the company's management of free cash flow.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r24pusmta3t81.jpg?width=1011&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84f887547a346576a97d2a8308d07aa42edbfea7

As you can see from the chart, the ratio of Amazon's operating cash flow generated over the past 12 months divided by the stock market value is also closely related to the change in the yield on the 10-year U.S. inflation-protected bond. As can be seen, the ratio has generally been trending downward as Amazon's trailing 12-month operating free cash flow has declined over the past few quarters.

Operating cash flow will be an important metric to watch in Amazon's quarterly earnings report, as if the metric continues to fall, it will only put more pressure on Amazon's stock; however, if the metric can rise, it should help boost its stock. share price.

However, as long as the Fed maintains a hawkish stance, fundamentals are unlikely to change Amazon's overall downward path. Because the challenges Amazon faces today have more to do with macro trends, the repricing of risky assets, where investors weigh the value of future earnings and cash flows in a higher interest rate environment, rather than fundamentals.

Amazon's technicals are very weak right now, with bearish signals rising from the pandemic lows. The stock has been trading lower since the beginning of 2022, when Amazon stock fell below its Trading Channel, and appears to be on the verge of falling to $2,890. However, the stock is unlikely to stop at $2,890 and more likely to reclaim lows around $2,650 in early March.

In addition, Amazon's Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending lower, with a longer-term downward trend. While the RSI is trending up in the short-term, the short-term RSI trend is more likely to be overwhelmed by the long-term RSI bearish momentum. It is understood that the relative strength index is to analyze the intention and strength of the market's buying and selling orders by comparing the average closing increase and the average closing decline in a period of time, so as to make a future market trend.

**Summarize**

Taken together, combined with Amazon's own bearish technical momentum and an upward trend in real yields, Amazon's stock price could fall further in the coming months.",u1xpe2,80,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/u1xpe2/us_debt_slumps_amazon_amznus_is_also_unable_to/

1300,The U.S. Fed Will Force Stocks Down,Opinion / Potentially Misleading,">In contrast to many other countries, the U.S. economy  doesn’t respond directly to the level of short-term interest rates. Most  home borrowers aren’t affected, because they have long-term, fixed-rate  mortgages. And, again in contrast to many other countries, many U.S.  households do hold a significant amount of their wealth in equities. As a  result, they’re sensitive to financial conditions: Equity prices  influence how wealthy they feel, and how willing they are to spend  rather than save.

SPY gained 8% and QQQ gained 13% in less than 2 weeks which seems surprising with the current environment when we have inflation out of control, high commodities prices and one of the worst fed tightening in decades.

I am not trying to time the market and I keep adding in undervalued stocks but I do not want to get dragged into ""FOMO"" rally. I am long-term bullish and I only have one cheap put contract as a small hedge. There is huge SPY puts flow but this could be MMs hedging their portfolios.

My take (not a financial advisor):

Bottom line: Nobody knows anything.

I think Fed is way behind the curve and they eventually will have to aggressive and do more rate hikes and slow economy. However, I think recession is less likely due to strong labor market. We might revisit close to Feb-Mar lows but it might not happen until Apr-May when companies start to report Q2 earnings and next FOMC meeting. QQQ might reach to \~365 and SPY to \~455 before another correction happens.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.

Simply put, the CPI is the go-to measure of inflation.

# Is inflation good or bad?

Generally, inflation is discussed with a negative connotation. The Federal Reserve Bank (the “Fed”) has a target inflation rate of 2.0%.

# What is a good level of inflation?

Target inflation has fluctuated between 1-and 2% over the years, which is considered healthy for a growing economy. Post pandemic, the Federal Reserve Bank (the “Fed”) has maintained a target inflation rate of 2.0%.

# What are the current CPI results?

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported an increase of 1.2% in the CPI for March 2022. Over the last twelve months, inflation has increased by 8.5%, which is significantly higher than the Fed’s target.

1308,European Inflation Soars to Record 7.5% in March,Industry News,"*Source:* [*https://uk.news.yahoo.com/charting-global-economy-european-inflation-090000565.html*](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/charting-global-economy-european-inflation-090000565.html)

Euro-zone inflation surged to a record 7.5% in March from a year ago as Russia’s war in Ukraine further boosted already soaring energy costs.

While that’ll cost consumers about 230 billion euros ($254 billion) this year, household savings should help cushion the blow. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge rose to a fresh four-decade high, and China’s Covid lockdowns threaten to disrupt supply chains and push up prices even more.

Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy:

**Europe**

Euro-zone inflation accelerated to a fresh record high as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled global supply chains and provided a fresh driver for already-soaring energy costs. Combined with inflation overshoots this week from Spain and Germany, the data prompted investors to bring forward bets on when the European Central Bank will end almost eight years of negative interest rates.

The energy crisis gripping the euro area will inflict an extra bill on consumers equivalent to 1.8% of its gross domestic product, according to analysis by Bloomberg Economics. Increased heating and electricity costs, along with higher prices of fuel for motorists, will combine to add 230 billion euros ($255 billion) to households’ expenses, Jamie Rush and Maeva Cousin estimate.

U.K. households saved less of their income in the final quarter of last year to maintain living standards in an early sign of the pressures they face from runaway inflation.

**U.S.**

The U.S. added close to half a million jobs in March and the unemployment rate fell by more than expected, highlighting a robust labor market that’s likely to support aggressive Fed tightening in the coming months.

Inflation-adjusted consumer spending declined in February, suggesting the fastest pace of price increases in four decades is starting to temper demand. Spending on goods settled back after the prior month’s surge, while a decline in Covid-19 cases supported a pickup in outlays for services.

U.S. business profits surged 35% last year, the most since 1950, driven by strong household demand as the economy bounced back from the pandemic. In all four quarters of the year, the overall profit margin stayed above 13%, a level reached in just one other three-month period during the past 70 years, Commerce Department data show.

**Asia**

China’s Covid lockdowns are putting the economy under strain and threatening to disrupt global supply chains, prompting Beijing to call for more contingency plans to deal with the risks. Purchasing managers’ indexes for March showed lockdowns in the technology and trade center Shenzhen and automotive city Changchun cut factory activity in the month. Services have also been hit hard.

Japan’s factory output in February eked out the first gain in three months, offering only a tepid sign of resilience amid fears the economy has slipped back into reverse. The fractional gain comes at a time when the Japanese economy needs strong manufacturing to help the economy avoid a contraction this quarter and to power a recovery going ahead.

**Emerging Markets**

Colombia surprised markets with a smaller-than-expected interest rate increase after the central bank was criticized by senior politicians. Analysts had expected a bigger boost given recent inflation shocks and an economy that is now operating close to full capacity. Central banks in Chile, Czech Republic and Mozambique were among those that also hiked rates.

An exodus of foreign workers from Saudi Arabia started to reverse after a year and a half as the economy recovers from the pandemic and oil prices rally. Job creation is the biggest challenge facing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto leader, as he reshapes an economy dependent on exporting oil and importing foreign labor.

**World**

Governments are not sufficiently aware of the longer-lasting economic fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, says Laurence Boone, OECD’s chief economist. Earlier this month, the Paris-based OECD estimated that the conflict’s effects will reduce global growth this year by more than 1 percentage point and drive up inflation another 2.5 percentage points from already-high levels.",tup35r,77,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tup35r/european_inflation_soars_to_record_75_in_march/

- Transitioning to EVs and realizing great synergies from a recent merger. 

Cons are:
- Paying a heavy dividend of over 7%. I’d rather see them reinvest or buy back shares. 
- Based in Europe. Adds complexity to taxes. The company handles revenue in Euros and is more exposed to the russian-ukraine situation than non-european manufacturers. 
- If oil stays high for years (something I’m hoping for with other positions) their truck and SUV sales will suffer.

  Hey stock traders & investors, we felt it was essential for us to have a small ""fireside"" talk and remind everyone of our rules regarding meme stocks, penny stocks, and crypto. 
Currently, we are receiving a lot of reports, and mod mails around ""meme"" stocks and crypto, and we want to clear the air here.
Lately, we're seeing more & more posts regarding meme stocks. We define meme stocks as a stock that has a significant following (like a cult) from a non-traditional trader; attracts considerable social media attention surrounding the stock; cult members follow mentions and brigade by sharing mass links upvote regardless of the quality; thread jacking every post and spamming the meme stock so no other stock can be discussed.

The main goal of the cult for any meme stock is to pump the price. 

 These are different from penny stocks which we class as stocks that have traded less than $5 / share over the last six months or have a market cap of less than $300m.

But penny stocks share something in common with meme stocks: The pump in price. However, they go through extreme pump & dump campaigns continually losing value making them ""cheap"" and where you encourage others to buy 100s of 1000s of shares thinking ""cheap"" is a good deal but the penny stock promoter sells their shares at the top of the pump, then repeats at a lower price convincing you to buy another round of 100s of 1000s of shares, either through group chats, spamming social media, or forums like these; it is illegal and will not be tolerated and you will face a ban.

 Crypto: We do not have any plans to allow crypto or NFT talk here that are unrelated to stocks. This subreddit is for stocks only. We will keep expanding crypto-related stocks like COIN if those discussions are related to the **quantitative**, **fundamental**, and **technical** aspects of said stock such as **price movements, cashflow, C-staff changes such as CEO replacements, earnings reports, product changes that will affect the stock price, etc**.
 
 Crypto specific or NFT specific posts will not be permitted and the mods will remove those posts. Repeat offenders will be banned.
We are aware that GME is pushing for an NFT store; GME has sales of $6B TTM so if the NFT store makes, let's say, less than 5% of the $6B sales ($300m TTM) we'll consider it crypto spam/shilling and remove it; **NFT hype for stocks is going to be considered crypto shilling.**

 Our best examples of meme stocks are AMC & GME, see the wiki below how we determined meme stocks in depth, but we all know GME is a meme and has several cults on Reddit. If you want to spam about GME then you can do that on other sub reddit, see the links and wikis below. 

 **We actually allow discussions on meme stocks.**  However, we need to ensure that we do not become simply a meme stock sub drowning in a flood of posts discussing the same exact stock every day, and to do that, we implemented some protocols we set up in 2020 when the meme stock mania took hold:

* We will limit the number of posts that are submitted to r/stocks that are around meme stocks.

* They must be high quality and based upon verifiable data.

  * News must come from a mainstream news broadcaster that focuses on stocks (for example, we will permit the Financial times, CNBC etc. but not Fox, BBC etc.).

  * Automod will remove Twitter or youtube posts. Automod will police this, and the method it decides what is low effort or not will change dynamically to deal with the volume of mentions of said meme stock.

 * We will not permit any conspiracy theories at all. There needs to be evidence and grounded.

  * While we have a criteria for meme stocks (see wiki below), the mods will have full discretion at all times. Simply posting the meme stock ticker and nothing else or similar low effort comments will be removed, and circumventing automod or another mod will result in a ban.

 * And with the help of the r/stocks community, whenever someone uses the report button to identify shilling, it helps the mod team focus their efforts on actual shilling and spam; thanks! 

 The users of r/stocks don't want to discuss the same exact stock multiple times a day, every single day, and we don't want to be shilled to.

We're desperately trying to warn the community of the manipulation that's going on here just to get you to pour your money into these types of things so that they can sell at a higher price and you're left holding the bag with no one to sell to. That's not how you build wealth in the long term with stocks. 

 See our [wiki on meme stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/meme-stocks) and our [wiki on crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/crypto-general) and please post to r/superstonk for GME fun/speculation/rumors/conspiracies and r/cryptocurrencies or r/cryptocurrency for crypto/NFTs, and see our main wiki for all the [related financial subs (or non financial subs like politics) (at the bottom).](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)

Arya said Nvidia shares fell sharply last week, likely due to concerns about its gaming business, which has also sent the stock down 26% so far this year. Arya speculates that market concerns may stem from the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict that may dampen demand for European customers, Chinese customers may be affected by the epidemic blockade measures, and cryptocurrency-related customers may be affected by the falling price of Ethereum and the POS consensus mechanism (representing Ethereum Blockchain security will transition from expensive power-hungry mining hardware to relying on staking tokens) resulting in reduced demand for graphics cards.

""While we point to these headwinds, we believe investors may be underestimating other supporting trends, including: strength in data centers, the Pro Viz platform and the automotive business in the second half,"" the analyst added, based on Hopper-structured gaming products and inventory replenishment will also boost the stock.

Arya pointed out that if Nvidia's gaming business were to decline, it would only have a 7%-9% impact on earnings per share. The analyst lays out a scenario for this, expecting Nvidia’s earnings per share to decline by 5% sequentially in the current quarter and 10% in the next quarter. ""It's worth noting that Nvidia's gaming business sales grow by an average of 25% every two years (a CAGR of 8% to 45%), while the above scenario assumes a two-year CAGR of only 25%,"" Arya wrote. 6%, well below the historical range.""

In the end, Arya concluded: ""Considering that Nvidia is increasing sales in the high barrier computing market at a CAGR of 20-25% (3 times the growth of the semiconductor industry) in the high barrier computing market, while maintaining more than 45% Industry-leading EBIT and we continue to view Nvidia as one of the most important growth companies in the semiconductor space, even in technology.” Currently, the analyst has a “buy” rating on Nvidia with a price target of 375 Dollar.",u2bcv7,69,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u2bcv7/bank_of_america_market_selloff_is_overdone_nvidia/

1320,Regulators are worried that inexperienced retail traders are getting in over their heads,," 

Do you like to trade options? How about leveraged and inverse ETFs? Want to buy structured notes?

These kinds of ""complex"" investment products have exploded in popularity in the last several years, particularly as self-directed investors have been trading at home during Covid.

Here's the bad news: Regulators are getting worried that you may be getting in over your head, and they seem to be looking to erect more ""guardrails"" to protect you against making stupid investments. They may even want you to take a test to prove you know what you're doing.

The recent market volatility is not helping, and likely making regulators even more nervous.

### FINRA is sending a warning signal

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority(FINRA) , which is the regulator for all the brokerage firms and exchanges in the U.S., recently released [a regulatory notice](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/22-08) to its members (brokerage firms), reminding them of the risks of these ""complex"" products and the legal obligations they have of making sure their investors are in products that are suitable for them.

""The number of accounts trading in complex products and options has increased significantly in recent years,"" FINRA wrote in the note. ""However, important regulatory concerns arise when investors trade complex products without understanding their unique characteristics and risks.""

FINRA reminded its members that Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), which was adopted in 2020, requires brokers to act in the ""best interest"" of the customer when making such recommendations. That means brokers need to be able to explain to clients the nature of the product they are recommending and the potential risks and rewards, and to determine if these investments are ""suitable"" for the client.

### FINRA wants broader rules on these products

FINRA said it was seeking comments on whether the current regulatory framework is adequate to protect investors. It noted that the old rules were adopted when most financial products were bought through financial professionals, whereas today many of these products are bought and sold through self-direct trading platforms like Robinhood or other online brokers.

""This is clearly a stalking horse for a new piece of rulemaking,"" Dave Nadig, financial futurist at ETF Trends, told me.

""The SEC is concerned there is a new raft of retail investors who are under-educated about what they are doing,"" Nadig said.

""It is partly a reaction to retail investing in options, but it is even broader than that. They are proposing to create a class of new products called 'complex' that is basically everything besides plain vanilla stocks and bonds.""

### 'Complex' products could include your crypto ETF fund

In its note, FINRA describes a complex product as ""a product with features that may make it difficult for a retail investor to understand the essential characteristics of the product and its risks (including the payout structure and how the product may perform in different market and economic conditions).""

These can include leveraged and inverse exchange-traded products, volatility-linked ETPs, structured products, and defined outcome ETFs, which offer exposure to the performance of a market index but with downside protection and an upside cap on potential gains over a specified period.

Also on the list: ""Mutual funds and ETFs that offer strategies employing cryptocurrency futures.""

""We continue to believe that the features of these products are such that they may be difficult for a retail investor to understand the essential characteristics of the products and their risks and, are, therefore complex,"" FINRA said.

""These concerns may be heightened when a retail customer is accessing these products through a self-directed platform and without the assistance of a financial professional, who may be in a position to explain the key features and risks of the product to the retail investor.""

FINRA is doing more than warning about these products. It is asking if additional requirements are necessary to protect investors.

It is particularly concerned about the growth of ""self-directed platforms"" and asks, ""are additional guardrails needed for these types of platforms?""

### Should retail traders be required to take tests?

FINRA also seems to want the retail investor to demonstrate a lot more knowledge of the products they are buying.

For example, it is asking whether retail customers should be required ""to demonstrate their understanding of those common characteristics and risks of complex products by completing a knowledge check and, if the customer fails to show the requisite knowledge, requiring the completion of a learning course and additional assessment?""

Essentially, FINRA is asking if retail traders should be required to pass a test before they can trade these products.

### FINRA is also worried about plain-vanilla options trading

Even the trading of options has become a source of concern. FINRA notes that listed options trading volume has grown to over 38.6 million contracts a day on average, 30% higher than 2020 and almost 100% higher than 2019.

""Similar to transactions in complex products, buying or selling options can be risky for retail investors who trade options without understanding their vocabulary, strategies and risks. Members should consider whether investors understand the various risks of trading options..."" FINRA said.

1321,Has anyone done a back test on the past 5-10 years to determine if buy and hold on fundamentally strong companies still hold true?,,"I’ve hunted down many fundamentally strong and fairly valued companies as of today’s world, and it seems like the prices of really good companies have been down for like 5 years at least. Whereas the growth stocks or even loss making unicorns seem to be having real fun (until they recently came back down to earth). Does it still work in today’s world, has the trend changed since Buffett first started investing?

Like, meme stocks show that clearly, fundamentals isn’t the only reason why stocks can cause a rise in today’s world. Then there’s also technical analysis which seems to be able to predict price movements better than fundamentals!

I’m unable to even say with conviction that generally, fundamentally strong and fairly priced companies will rise better than stocks that are not. Coz that’s just not what I observed.

If anyone has some substantial good back test results to share, that would be much appreciated. I’m just trying to determine if technical analysis is more suitable in today’s climate, for instance. Or following the news. Or growth stocks. Or follow social media. Or whatever it is.",thyb5l,73,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/thyb5l/has_anyone_done_a_back_test_on_the_past_510_years/
1322,Seeking El Dorado - Finding the next Amazon amid all the hype,Fundamentals/DD,"Recently, I came across [this viral tweet](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1500986096745779200) that tried to capture the various generation-defying stats of our time. The story is that Jeff Bezos left his high-paying job at a private equity firm to start Amazon after seeing that the internet was growing by 2,300% per year! The tweet prompted a lot of great examples of industries and tech that are growing extremely fast.

While not all of us can leave our jobs to follow a fast-growing trend, something we can do is invest in such companies/industries. For example, over the past 20 years, tech (QQQ) has given [2x the return](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/red-pill?s=w) of the S&P 500 while almost having a similar risk profile and max drawdown.

Another fantastic example is Moore’s Law in microprocessors. Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, hypothesized in 1965 that the number of transistors that will fit on a microprocessor will double every two years while simultaneously costing less. More than 50 years later, we still observe Moore’s law in effect and it has left a lasting impact on both computing and electronics\[1\].

The reason I brought up these two examples is to highlight the disproportionate returns you could have generated investing in these fields early on - Imagine getting into e-commerce in the early 2000s or microprocessors in the early 80s. So in this issue, let’s deep-dive into some of the fastest-growing industries of our time and see where and how we can invest in them!

https://preview.redd.it/gvpdxc0ghqp81.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=924093f8a5c19295dc33ea527d6939ec3d0460d4

**Lithium-Ion Batteries**

https://preview.redd.it/phiizunihqp81.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbec8fc0e33a754f008f219dae75d85ac008f45e

The price of lithium-ion batteries has fallen more than 97% in the last 3 decades. It is in ubiquitous use, in everything from our phones to electric cars. If you are still not convinced about the breakthroughs here, the fastest-growing 10-year-old company in the world is battery-maker [CATL](https://twitter.com/tsungxu/status/1491912243658858499). The company has grown 125% in its 10th year with a revenue of $15 Billion. That makes it double the growth rate of Stripe, Facebook, and AWS when they were 10 years old!

This is literally comparable to selling shovels during a gold rush as all the electric car manufacturers trying to one-up each other using VC money **have to buy batteries from these companies.**

https://preview.redd.it/8u6v80wjhqp81.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=70453708b41f25ae5f7e64217716aa77a268b2f8

The accelerating rate of battery technology/demand is captured perfectly by [LIT ETF](https://etfdb.com/etf/LIT/#etf-ticker-profile) where in the first five-six years of its inception it barely gave any return but in the next five, it has doubled the return generated by the S&P 500!

https://preview.redd.it/9nli2tdhhqp81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc0ec062dad6c555ae3c9f1116314fc836130a8

**Gene Mapping**

https://preview.redd.it/z3dyxielhqp81.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdac7f6d3b53f4933e88d940ce36d5e050b9609a

The cost of mapping a Human Genome has fallen from $100MM in 2001 to less than $1k in 2021. That’s a 1,00,000x reduction in price over a period of 2 decades. This has beaten Moore’s law and then some! If you are wondering about the applications of genome mapping, it can be used to identify genes that cause hereditary diseases, cancer, and can also identify favorable traits in farming and animal husbandry. There are broader uses such as in Forensics as well as in creating personalized treatments for diseases.

https://preview.redd.it/8t5sqf6mhqp81.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7279bd5d1bc6cb8ad0b91bbab84f84ac9483f96

One of the largest ETFs that tracks Genomic improvements is ARKG. It has returned in line with S&P500 after its inception in 2014. But at its ATHs in 2021, the fund almost had 5x the return of the S&P 500!

https://preview.redd.it/0mvb2dehhqp81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=60333072f63e22685da3d570cdbf70f4c7ca1cc4

**Lab-Grown Meat**

https://preview.redd.it/u0ar5kbnhqp81.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27533dcd08fda55a441c6a2e80f8eb266a3f00f

We all know that eating meat has a [high environmental impact](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-59232599). But the good news is that the cost of lab-grown meat has dropped 90% in the last 2 years and it’s expected to drop another 99.5% in the next 3-4 years. Once/if the artificial meat develops the same taste profile as the real thing and costs much less than the current method of animal husbandry, there would be a massive shift in the dietary habits (especially in the case of fast foods where we are already seeing an increasing shift towards plant-based meats).

I could not find any active ETFs that have a stake in these companies as most of the players in this space are currently still private. The only one I could find was a London-based venture capital firm called Agronomics that focuses on investing in Cellular agriculture. It has returned 289%\[2\] since its inception (Oct’20) when compared to 40% returned by the S&P 500 during the same time period.

https://preview.redd.it/z0vecwehhqp81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef837b4d372569f9bee89e71baf90861b0e29b6e

**Space Flight**

https://preview.redd.it/zfu7cepohqp81.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=12f8c4cbef35f545d888e661747272f83d27fe9e

The cost of space flight has also undergone an exponential reduction in the last few decades with the cost to send 1kg into orbit being more than $50k in the 1980s to less than $1k now with SpaceX coming into play, with its reusable stages and fairings.

It’s not just big players such as SpaceX and ULA that are in the race to reduce the cost of space flight. There are 100s of [small players ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_private_spaceflight_companies)who are trying their hand at getting into orbit in a variety of different ways. All of this means that we would get cheaper access to satellite internet, more accurate GPS, and better weather and terrain mapping.

There are only limited ETFs in the space as its a pretty new field for private players. The biggest one I could find was [UFO (Procure Space ETF)](https://procureetfs.com/ufo/) with $90MM+ under management. We do not have any meaningful backtests as the fund was launched only in 2019.\[3\]

https://preview.redd.it/59c1shfhhqp81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=e71043e38505b42cc541d4f46f16d63a45126e14

**Cyber Security**

https://preview.redd.it/gqimgycqhqp81.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a11280ae023c901e25afd77fb062e0ee41febca6

The number of cyber-attacks against companies and individuals is increasing exponentially. Ransomware attacks now cost more than $20B in damage every year. Companies going virtual due to the Covid crisis have only accelerated the trend. Adding to this, the number of IoT devices has exploded in recent years contributing to more weak spots for hackers to exploit.

What is more concerning is that there are [more and more attacks](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/02/20-ransomware-statistics-youre-powerless-to-resist-reading/) against critical government organizations such as power stations, nuclear plants, schools, and municipalities. All of this means that companies in the cybersecurity field are expected to rake in a fortune in the next decade.

One of the biggest ETFs in the cybersecurity field is the First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF with more than $6.5 billion under management. Since its inception in 2015, it has slightly outperformed the S&P 500.

**Other Promising Industries**

I cannot possibly cover all the high potential industries and their performance in a single article. So here are some industries that I think have the potential to disrupt our world in the next few decades and some of the most popular ETFs associated with them.

1. Solar/Clean energy - A new solar plant is now 3x cheaper than a coal one and the cost per unit of solar energy has dropped by a factor of 5x in just the last decade ([iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251911/ishares-global-clean-energy-ucits-etf?switchLocale=y&siteEntryPassthrough=true))
2. [E-Sports](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1443403507957002242) \- E-sports viewership has outpaced major league sports, and the prize money has grown more than 4,000x in the last 2 decades.
3. Crypto Adoption - Crypto adoption is closely following the internet adoption trend and the current trajectory predicts more than 1B users by 2027!
4. AI - The scale of AI models has grown [more than 1,00,000x](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1501729837366452224?s=20&t=0vlq_iPiTKl5TwV06W-BWA) in just the last 3 years. This would be instrumental in creating self-driving tech as well a starting point for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) ([BOTZ - Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/botz/))
5. Autonomous driving - This will be closely associated with the development of AGI. Whoever cracks this is going to have a monopoly over a multi-trillion dollar industry. Think about it. If you have fully autonomous driving, all Ubers can be driver-free, all inter-state transportation can be done without truckers, etc. The applications would be endless ([iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/307332/ishares-self-driving-ev-and-tech-etf))
6. [Global Fertility Rates](https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate) have halved over the past 50 years. This represents an unprecedented issue where the number of old people would overtake the number of young people leading to a demographic crisis. All our capitalistic systems such as Pension, 401K, healthcare, taxes, etc. are designed under the assumption that the number of people in the workforce would far outweigh the number of retirees. A sudden shift might be catastrophic.

https://preview.redd.it/2hjv6nghhqp81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=62e09cbb312fc9f05b0fe0fd55df6b131c3db598

**Some Caveats**

Before you try to invest in any of these industries/stocks, you should be aware of the following.

**On Returns**

While judging the returns, please note that most of the above would fall into the category of extreme growth stocks. As such, their returns would have taken an extra hit in the current bear market that we are in. The S&P500 is down 8.2% YTD. Growth stocks generally have a high Beta which would cause them to drop down even further. All these backtests would have looked very different just 3 months back - Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta taketh away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.

**On ETFs vs Stocks**

I have focused on broad ETFs here because that’s the easiest and safest way to get exposure to these industries. There is definitely a higher likelihood of abnormal gains if you are willing to take the risk of finding an individual company that you can invest in for the long haul. For reference, over the past 2 decades, Nasdaq gave a 965% return but Amazon gave a 21,800% return!

**On Hype**

>it's much easier to remember the technologies that succeed (we're surrounded by them) rather than the technologies that fail. - **Michael Mullany**

[This](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/8-lessons-from-20-years-hype-cycles-michael-mullany/) is an excellent article that highlights hindsight and survivorship bias that we show while predicting the future. Not all the technologies that are hyped for their growth make their way into mainstream usage (Ultrawideband, RSS Enterprise, Desktop Linux), and technologies that were under the radar the whole time suddenly exploded into popularity (eg. Open Source, NoSQL, x86 virtualization).

https://preview.redd.it/cvwbr4hhhqp81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=7472e8da03ed6d3d7442111c5094116a1a1dd8a7

**Conclusion**

It’s very hard to predict the future. For every Amazon, there are 100s of pets.com. For every promising industry that became mainstream, there were a hundred others that were equally promising and died out. Maybe we wouldn’t end up liking the lab-grown meat, or some phenomenal breakthrough in Nuclear Fusion could make all the other renewable energy like Wind and Solar obsolete overnight!

We are definitely minimizing the risk by betting on industries instead of single companies. I would like to think of it as running our own private equity firm. By making a lot of small bets on these upcoming industries, when we are wrong (which we would be the majority of the time), our losses would be small but when we get it right, the outsized returns would dwarf all our other small losses!

Making an investment against all of these uncertainties is certainly difficult. But then again, if it was easy, everyone would be doing it!

***Comment below in case I missed out on any big trends that you think should be covered. I will keep adding to the list.***

1331,Buffett's Alpha academic paper review and takeaways,,"I recently came across the paper [Buffett’s Alpha](http://docs.lhpedersen.com/BuffettsAlpha.pdf). It’s an award-winning, highly technical paper filled with math equations and other heavy financial modeling to understand how Warren Buffett, probably America’s greatest investor, was able to consistently significantly outperform the market for almost six decades with an overall 19% compound annual growth rate!

I read this long and technical paper so you don’t have to, and have summarized its findings below.

There are four things that helped Buffett with his edge:  

* Investing style
* Finesse with leverage
* Minimal outside money
* Lucky to start in the 60s

# Investing style

The paper uses the Carhart four-factor model to summarize Buffett’s investing style and explain where his alpha (stock market jargon for market outperformance) comes from.

The first Carhart factor, MKT, showed that Berkshire’s stock was less volatile than the rest of the market and significantly outperformed it, which we already know. The second factor, small-minus-big (SMB), showed that Berkshire tended to buy large stocks. The third factor, called the value factor (HML), showed that Berkshire tended to buy stocks that had a high book value relative to their market value. That is to say, Buffett bought cheap stocks. The final factor, the momentum factor (UMD), showed that Buffett is not a momentum investor and didn’t chase trends in his stock selection.

However, the paper states that these four standard factors actually don’t explain Buffett’s alpha. As such, it introduces two more factors to measure Berkshire’s performance by. First, the Betting Against Beta (BAB) factor which showed that Berkshire tended to buy low risk (low volatility) stocks. Second, the Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) factor, showed that Berkshire tended to buy companies that were profitable and growing. By controlling for just the BAB and QMJ factors, Berkshire’s public stock portfolio’s alpha is driven down to a statistically insignificant value.

Therefore, the main reason for Buffett’s success is his preference for low risk stocks that are profitable and growing.

# Finesse with leverage

Buffett was able to obtain cheap leverage by buying insurance companies and using the insurance float as a sort of leverage. This was his genius. The insurance business model of charging insurance premium up front and paying out claims at a future date is essentially borrowing money from customers. When done properly, these loans are super cheap, significantly cheaper than the interest rates of the day.

Compound interest goes both ways, and an annual interest cost of 2% vs 5%, for example, makes a tremendous difference in the returns of a leveraged portfolio over time.

Even with cheap leverage, however, Buffett didn't really use a lot of it. According to the paper, about 1.6:1. This restrained use of leverage showed that Buffett was very careful and strategic with how he used it, and instead relied on consistent compound growth aided with just a little bit of borrowed money to achieve spectacular results.

# Minimal outside money

Another stroke of genius from Buffett to achieve his long-running success is how he structured what is essentially his investment fund. Buffett closed off Berkshire from outside money very early on and more or less managed his own money throughout the decades. This might seem insignificant and perhaps even limited the amount of money Buffett could’ve made if he took on outside investments and charged a management and performance fee similar to modern hedge funds. However, even though Buffett stunted his short term income by avoiding outside money, this decision was key to Berkshire’s long term survival.

For example, from June 30th 1998 to February 29th, 2000, Berkshire lost 44% of its market value while the overall stock market gained 32%. If Berkshire had outside money, this would've probably killed the fund with an onslaught of redemptions from anxious outside investors.

# Lucky to start in the 60s

Finally, it'd be remiss not to mention that even though Buffett employed significant skill in achieving such long-running success, he was also incredibly lucky to start investing in the time period that he did. This was a time period where access to information was low, thus increasing market inefficiencies and creating the underpriced companies that Buffett was able to invest in, and also the beginning of a multi-decade contraction of interest rates and expansion of the money supply by the Federal Reserve that is still ongoing today. In fact, just a few years after Buffett acquired Berkshire Hathaway, Nixon ended the gold standard, effectively giving a green light to the Federal Reserve to massively inflate the US dollar supply. This has unsurprisingly been a boon for the US stock market’s dollar-valuation.

If Buffett were to start investing today, it’s unlikely that he’d come even close to the performance he managed to achieve with Berkshire Hathaway since 1965. With the widespread availability of the Internet, and very accommodative central bank policies all over the world, markets are much more efficient and bloated. It’s incredibly hard to find the sort of deep value companies Buffett found in the 60s, 70s, and 80s to jumpstart Berkshire.

Despite indexes selling off it appears there was some rotation into high-valued growth stocks, which almost seems bullish.

Just wondered what you guys thought of this because this seems to be a reversal of what we've been seeing since the beginning of the sell-off. Since late November overvalued growth tech has been getting crushed while mega caps like MSFT, AAPL and GOOG have been acting fairly defensively.

# **Big banks’ earnings and a hot inflation report could sway markets in short holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/big-banks-earnings-and-a-hot-inflation-report-could-sway-markets-in-short-holiday-week.html)**
*****
> Markets face what could be a hot inflation report in the week ahead and a batch of big bank earnings to start the earnings season.
*****
> JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock kick off the financial industry’s first-quarter earnings releases Wednesday, with Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs reporting Thursday.
*****
> The war in Ukraine will remain a focus, as investors look for any signs of change in the crisis.
*****
> Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said the first-quarter earnings reports from the financial sector will be important to a market considering the impact of the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates and aggressively tighten policy.
*****
> “We want to get a picture of how do they see the Fed’s plan... quantitative tightening, the liquidity drain, coupled with higher rates, affecting their clients and their business units,” said Krosby. “If you look at the XLF [Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF], on days it goes up, it’s the insurance companies because they’re raising premiums. Higher rates are good for banks, until, the belief is, the higher rates are going to hurt the economy.”
*****
> For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%, but the interest rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite was down 3.9% and the S&P 500 was off 1.3%. For a third week in a month, the jump in the 10-year Treasury yield topped 30 basis points, according to Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher. A basis point equals 0.01%.
*****
> The 10-year rose above 2.7% on Friday.
*****
> “It’s been on jet fuel,” said Schumacher. He said the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, got a boost in the past week from the Fed’s signal that it is planning to trim its balance sheet by $95 billion a month, of which about $60 billion will be in Treasurys.
*****
> The 10-year is important as a benchmark and also because it is a rate that affects mortgages and other loans.
*****
> “People are saying the balance sheet is going to cause the 10s to move quite a bit,” said Schumacher. He said he could not rule out a move in the yield to 3%, given the speed at which the yield has moved recently.
*****
> Economic data in the coming week could be a catalyst for another move higher.
*****
> The four-day holiday week is packed with economic reports. Some will be released on the Good Friday market holiday. The highlight is Tuesday’s report of March’s consumer price index, which is expected to top the 7.9% reported for February.
*****
> “It’s big. It’s the last key data point before the Fed meets May 3,” said Schumacher. A hot number, even in line with expectations, will encourage the market to expect a 50-basis-point hike, or a half percent, from the Fed at that meeting. The Fed began its rate hiking cycle in March with a quarter-point increase.
*****
> The producer price index is set for release on Wednesday. Data on retail sales and consumer sentiment are due Thursday. On the Friday market holiday, Empire state manufacturing and industrial production are released.
*****
> Barclays economists expect CPI rose 1.24% in March, gaining a stunning 8.5% year-over-year, the highest in 40 years. “We expect the annual rate of CPI to peak in March and move lower thereon, aided by positive base effects,” the economists wrote.
*****
> The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures deflator is released April 29, but CPI and PPI will both set the tone for that report.
*****
> “We’ve had such a sharp move in yields. Sentiment is so dour in rates, I wouldn’t be surprised if we got a relief rally in rates after we see the March CPI,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
> “While inflation pressures are still going to be here, I think March would be the peak inflation rate on a rate of change basis... You could get some rotation [in stocks] next week if you get a bond bounce,” said Boockvar.
*****
> Schumacher said the bond market will also be watching the Bank of Canada for an expected rate hike when it meets Wednesday, and the European Central Bank for comments on its bond purchases at its Thursday meeting.
*****
> # Earnings season
According to Refinitiv, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1% in the first quarter, but the financial sector is expected to see a decline of 22.9%.
*****
> LPL’s Krosby expects to see choppy trading. “I think it’s going to be a difficult quarter,” she said. She said investors will be watching to see how the market absorbs a 50-basis-point hike. Quantitative tightening, balance sheet reductions known as QT, is also a policy tightening.
*****
> “The QT could start next month. There’s a sense [the Fed] can’t wait any longer,” she said.
*****
> Krosby said she recommends a defensive focus, favoring consumer staples, real estate investment trusts and health care, as well as consumer discretionary names that emphasize cost savings for consumers.

> “I suspect at the end of next week, with the long weekend ahead, people will want to cut risk, but I suspect it could be a pretty rocky ride with CPI before we see that,” said Schumacher.

> # Treasuries Yields Blow Past Dividend Yields

> US Treasury yields have experienced a dramatic move higher as the market prices in continued rate hikes in the near future. With the increase in long-term Treasury yields, we're starting to see what looks like the end of a period where the S&P 500 and the 10-year Treasury fought back and forth over which asset class had a more attractive yield.

> As shown in the chart below, from 1970 right up to the period before the global financial crisis, the 10-year yield consistently yielded more than the S&P 500. As the Fed cut rates to zero during the crisis, though, the S&P 500 went on to see multiple periods where its dividend yield was in excess of the 10-year Treasury yield. With the recent surge in yields as the Fed embarks on what the market expects to be an aggressive rate hiking cycle, the script has been completely flipped. The 10-year now offers a roughly 125 bps higher yield than the S&P 500 dividend yield which is the widest spread since the fall of 2018 and before that, the fall of 2011. As the spread between the S&P 500 dividend yield and 10-year Treasury yield hits the low end of the GFC/post-GFC era, we would note that current levels are still roughly 200 bps higher than the historical average going back to 1970.

> # Bulls Head for the Hills Once Again

> After peaking at 32.8% two weeks ago, bullish sentiment continues to roll over as the S&P 500 has erased some of the March gains this week. After this week's decline of 7.2 percentage points in bullish sentiment, less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. While low, that is still a few percentage points above the weaker levels from February.

> ###### **([https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bulls.png))**

> Bearish sentiment in turn rose 13.9 percentage points which was the biggest one-week uptick since August 2019 when it rose 24.14 percentage points. At 41.4%, bearish sentiment is now at the highest level since the week of March 17th. That is an elevated reading and a big move week over week, but it is also well off recent highs from the past few months that were more than 10 percentage points higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bears.png))**

> The bull-bear spread tipped into positive territory for the first time in 2022 last week, but the big inverse moves between bulls and bears erased much of the past few weeks' move. The spread is down to -16.7 which is still 13.6 points above the late February low of -30.3.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> The big pickup in the number of respondents reporting as bearish didn't entirely come from the bullish camp. Neutral sentiment also shed a significant amount falling from 40.6% last week to 33.9%. That is essentially mean reversion as neutral sentiment now sits only a couple of points above the historical average.

> # Near Record Low in Jobless Claims

> This week's jobless claims release was significant in a couple of ways. For starters, the Department of Labor revised seasonal adjustment factors (more on that below) and second, the most recent print for the seasonally adjusted number hit one of the lowest levels on record. Claims came in at 166K which tied the number from two weeks ago (after revisions) for the second-lowest reading on record behind the week of 11/29/68. That week's reading was only 4K lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> As for continuing claims, this week's reading was higher rising from 1.506 million to 1.523 million. Having come off last week's low, that remains one of the strongest levels since 1970.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> Pivoting back to initial claims, while adjusted claims are at multi-decade lows, non-seasonally adjusted claims are very healthy but not quite at a record. At current levels of 193.1K, the only year with a lower reading for the comparable week of the year was 1969 (170K) but at the seasonal lows in the few years prior to the pandemic, claims were even stronger than they are now. So while unadjusted claims are strong, the seasonally adjusted number was even more eyecatching this week.

> As for why the seasonally adjusted number appears so much stronger, as shown in the second chart below, the current week of the year has historically been the second most consistent week of the year in seeing a week-over-week increase in claims. As a period with consistent seasonal headwinds, the seasonal adjustment would control for this by depressing the level of claims by a relatively strong seasonal factor. That usual increase was not seen this year as NSA claims were actually slightly lower falling from 196.8K to 193.1K. That means seasonal adjustment helped out what was already a strong number.

> Additionally worth noting this week is the DOL changed its seasonal adjustment methodology. The DOL fully describes the change in this week's release and links to further reading on the topic for those interested in going deeper into the weeds, but to briefly summarize: periods when the level of an economic indicator experiences historic shifts in levels as claims did in 2020 and 2021, multiplicative adjustment (which has been used in ""normal times"" like prior to the pandemic and from here forward) would tend to over or understate adjusted claims. Additive adjustment, on the other hand, is less affected by the actual level of the indicator meaning it would lead to more accurate approximations of seasonally adjusted numbers in times of sudden spikes in the series. This methodology has been used throughout the pandemic period. Now that claims have more or less returned to a more normal range of readings, the DOL sees it justifiable to switch the seasonal adjustment methodology back to multiplicative. While that does not mean too much for interpreting claims, that change in methodology has led to some large downward revisions.

> # 10 Things To Know About Inverted Yield Curves

> One of the biggest stories over the past few weeks has been the inversion of various points on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The more well-known 2-year/10-year yield curve spread inverted on April 1, 2022 for the first time since 2019, while the 5-year/30-year inverted for the first time since 2006 on March 28.

> What is a yield curve? The yield curve plots the yield of different maturity bonds, usually Treasuries. In normal times, a longer dated bond should have a higher yield than a shorter dated bond. Historically, after key parts of the yield curve invert, the economy eventually has moved into a recession. This is why these signals are quiet important.

> Here are ten things to know about the yield curve.

> * Yes, past recessions have been proceeded by an inverted yield curve, but by no means does it happen right away. Another way to put it is yield curve inversions have preceded all recessions, but not all inverted yield curves lead to a recession. Historically, when the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverts, a recession has taken place an average about 19 months later.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.5.22.png))**

> * What about stocks? “One of the bigger surprises for investors is that stocks historically have actually done quite well after previous inversions,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the S&P 500 Index gained another 29% on average and peaked nearly 17 months later after the previous four inversions.” The bottom line is a yield curve inversion is a warning sign, but by no means does that mean trouble is coming immediately.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.5.22.png))**

> * In the LPL Research Chart of the Day (shown below), here is how the S&P 500 has done after all the 2-year/10-year inversions going back to the mid-1960s. Once again, some of the more recent performance has been quite impressive.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-3-4.5.22.png))**

> * One thing investors seem to be ignoring lately though is the short-end of the curve. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) came out recently saying as much in Don’t Fear the Yield Curve. They concluded that the 2-year/10-year yield curve wasn’t a good indicator for recessions; instead the near-term spread between the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has been much better. Take note that the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has steepened significantly the past few months, reducing the chances of a recession. Speaking of the Fed, Chairman Powell said last month that the economy was on firm footing and would be able to withstand rate hikes. In other words, the Fed isn’t worried about a recession quite yet.

> * Along these lines, the 3-month/10-year yield curve recently was at its steepest level in 5 years! This has been our personal favorite part of the yield curve to use as a signal for a pending recession (as the 2-year/10-year has given false signals before) and if and until this curve inverts, we believe the odds of a recession on the horizon is limited.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4-4.5.22.png))**

> * Yield curves are one part of the bond market, but what the credit markets are saying is another (think of them as bond investors take on financial conditions) and we see a much different opinion here. Lately, high yield bonds have outperformed Treasuries ( Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield index and the Bloomberg US Treasury index), a clue the credit markets weren’t very worried about economic growth going forward. In the past, trouble starts brewing when high yield underperforms Treasuries.

> * Adding to this, spreads on high yield and investment grade corporates have both come back significantly the past few weeks. “To see credit markets showing major signs of improvement the past few weeks is a great sign that financial conditions are probably better than most think,” explained Detrick. “Yes, the yield curve is flashing some warnings, but overall the credit markets are saying don’t get overly worried just yet.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-5-4.5.22.png))**

> * Real rates (rates adjusted for inflation) are negative. With the 10-year breakeven rate, what the bond market thinks inflation will average over the next 10 years, currently near 2.8% and the 10-year Treasury yield currently near 2.5%, real yields are actually negative. Historically, negative real rates have been quite bullish for risk assets. The Roaring 1920s, then during the 1940s and 1950s, were the last time we saw an extended period of negative real rates. As history told us, those decades saw explosive growth and stock market gains.

> * Real yield curves (adjusted for inflation) are still upwardly sloping. Take note, we’ve seen real yields invert ahead of recessions in the past along with nominal yield curves (2006 and 2019 most recently), yet another clue a recession might not be as close as some fear. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs noted that nominal curves tend to invert more easily in high inflation environments (we can check this box now), suggesting it would take a deeper inversion than recent cycles to trigger a recession signal.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-6-4.5.22.png))**

> * Lastly, the Fed owns nearly $9 trillion in bonds and 25% of the entire Treasury market. Who knows where yields would be if they didn’t own any, but most agree longer-term yields would likely be much higher. So maybe various yield curves wouldn’t be inverted or even that close to inverting? This concept is mere conjecture, but it is a note we’ve seen lately that is at least worth pointing out.

> There is a lot to digest here and this isn’t an easy subject, but the bottom line is the takeaway isn’t as simple as an inverted yield curve means a recession is imminent.

> # April’s Stellar Track Record

> April has been nearly perfect with gains steadily building from the first trading day to the last with only the occasional and minor blip along the way. DJIA has been up 16 Aprils in a row with an average gain of 2.9%. S&P 500 has been up 15 of the last 16 Aprils with an average gain of 3.1%

> April is last month of the Best Six Months November-April and when we begin tracking our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal. But before the “Worst Months” arrive, April’s solid historical track record could keep the current rally intact.

> April got off to its usual stellar start the first two trading days of the month, but some surprisingly hawkish remarks from the usually dovish Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard has stocks on the ropes today.

> Barring any major escalation in Ukraine, we suspect the market to log additional gains in April as the Best Six Months come to a close and then move sideways during much of Q2 and Q3. Likely testing the lows before rallying in Q4 and into 2023.

> Our “Best Six Months” switching strategy found in our annual Stock Trader’s Almanac which is basically the flipside of the old “sell in May and Go Away” adage. After decades of historical research, we discovered that most market gains occur during the months November through April. Investing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between November 1st and April 30th each year and then switching into fixed income for the other six months has produced reliable returns with reduced risk since 1950.

1345,What’s the downside of investing in high-yield dividend stocks?,Advice,"Beginner here. Was looking at different stock investing strategies, and one that came up was investing in high-yield dividend stocks. 

From what I understand, investing in this manner may not get you the greatest returns year after year, but it’s a safe means of investing. 

For example, let’s say you invested in 100 shares each valued at $100, for a total initial investment of $10k. And this company had a 10% dividend. 

Three things could happen. The markets could go up, down or stay the same. 

If the market goes up 10%, then you now have $11k in stocks + 1k in dividends for a total of $12k (gained $2k)

If the market stays the same, you have $10k in stocks + 1k in dividends for a total of $11k (gained $1k)

And if the market drops by 10%, you have $9k in stocks + $1k in dividends for a total of $10k (gained or lost nothing)

But there seems to be a [small turnaround from Chinese government](https://www.finews.asia/finance/36531-could-beijing-s-audit-concessions-mark-a-turnaround-for-chinese-stocks):

> Beijing is preparing to make concessions on the disclosure of some audit information. Regulators are finalizing plans on what financial audit information can and cannot be disclosed abroad, which would provide further clarity on a law that currently prohibits foreign regulators from conducting investigations within China.

What is your take on the sincerity of this change in Chinese government's stance. Why the sudden turnaround? I thought China was eager to bring more of their stocks back to China where they can be better controlled. 

Is this perhaps a sign that a new more liberal group of party officials are now in control (unlikely imo)? Or maybe Chinese government know their economy is about to tank so they're trying to bring in as much foreign investment as possible?

1358,"The uranium sector is evolving towards a growing global supply deficit, while the uranium price is still to cheap to incentivise new production + a couple uranium companies that have some catching up to do compared to peers",Fundamentals/DD,"Hi everyone,

The uranium sector is in a multi-year bull run.

Yesterday the uranium spotprice was going back up, and it will continue (with higher lows and higher highs) in the coming months and in 2023/2024 (imo, based on my own profound DD the last 8 years on that sector)

&#x200B;

[Source: John Quakes99 on twitter](https://preview.redd.it/186oj4c8lwo81.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=558d9b5940a0c67d90adb2cf1e1a93a7d71edafc)

An other uranium spotprice source: Numerco. 

Note: The uranium price on the website of Kitco Metals isn't up to date. They only update it once a week. 55 USD/lb is the price of past week, not of today.

Even an uranium price of 58 USD/lb isn't high enough to incentivise new uranium production for the future. The uranium term price is only at 43.88 USD/lb (updated once a month (UxC and Tradetech)) and will most probably increase significantly higher 9days from now.

There are different ways to get exposure to the uranium sector:

1) Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN. on the TSX, SRUUF on US stock  exchange): trust only investing in physical uranium. [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)

2) Yellow Cake (YCA on the london stock exchange): fund only investing in physical uranium. [https://www.yellowcakeplc.com/](https://www.yellowcakeplc.com/)

In my opinion, U.UN and YCA are the safest ways to get exposure to the uranium sector, because here you don't have the mining related risks. 

**Yellow Cake also has some catching up to do. With an uranium spotprice of 58.00 USD/lb, the NAV of Yellow Cake is at 458.90 GBX/share**

&#x200B;

[Source](https://preview.redd.it/mz8fyi08owo81.png?width=237&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ab11d675c4e25c6bcf124fae4bbf65ef8dce86f)

 

3) URNM etf ( [https://urnmetf.com/urnm](https://urnmetf.com/urnm) ) and HURA etf: well diversified and well balanced 100% pure uranium sector funds

4) URA etf and GCL (london): diversified 70% pure uranium sector funds

5) Individual  uranium companies: uranium producers (Cameco, Kazatomprom, Paladin Energy, ...) and well advanced uranium developers (Global Atomic, Denison Mines, Fission Uranium Corp, Goviex Uranium, ...)

&#x200B;

If you compare the Enterprise value in USD / pounds U3O8 in reserve between different producers today (John Quakes99 on twitter regularly posts an overview of most uranium companies with different data on each company), you will notice that Kazatomprom, Paladin Energy and Peninsula Energy are significantly cheaper than their peers on the TSX and US stock exchange

**In the producers category:**

Cameco ( [CCO.TO](https://CCO.TO) ) closed at 36.85 CAD/sh yesterday --> USD EV / lb resource = 10.63 USD/lb U3O8

**Paladin Energy** ([PDN.AX](https://PDN.AX) and PALAF on US stock exchange) before opening is at 0.86 AUD/sh today --> USD EV / lb resource = 4.35 USD/lb U3O8 --> **My short term price target: 1.39 AUD/share**

**Peninsula Energy** before opening is at 0.23 AUD/sh today --> USD EV / lb resource = 2.89 USD/lb U3O8 --> **My short term price target: 0.36 AUD/share**

**Kazatomprom** ( KAP on london stock exchange) has a share price of 31.50 USD/share at the moment --> USD EV / lb resource = 6.77 USD/lb U3O8, but Kazatomprom has the cheapest uranium production cost in the world and more than 50% of their future uranium sales will be with China. Another part will go to India, Russia, Europe and USA. **In my opinion Kazatomprom has some serious catching up to do compared to Cameco's value today.** A few months ago Kazatomprom traded at 49 USD/share while the uranium spot price was significantly lower than today. --> **My short term price target: 46.00 USD/share**

&#x200B;

And if you are patient, those uranium company shares will go significantly higher in 2023/2024 than my short term price targets mentioned in this post.

This isn't financial advice. I'm only expressing my own opinion based on my own DD on the matter. If you are looking for macro DD on the   uranium/nuclear sector: Kevin Bambrough, John Quakes99, Brandon Munro,  Mike Alkin, my macro posts on Reddit, ...

[Nvidia ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/nvda)is doubling down on artificial-intelligence technology that CEO Jensen Huang predicts will revolutionize every industry.

In the keynote speech for the annual Nvidia (ticker: NVDA) GTC conference—the acronym once stood for GPU Technology Conference, a reference to the company’s roots in graphics processing chips—Huang focused specifically on expanding the company’s portfolio of AI-focused chips and software applications. A highly anticipated virtual meeting with analysts was scheduled for after his talk.

Among other things, Huang unveiled Nvidia’s new “Hopper” chip family, named for the computer-science pioneer Grace Hopper, which succeeds the company’s current Ampere AI chip architecture announced two years ago. The company introduced the H100, a processor with 80 billion transistors, which it calls the “world’s most advanced chip.”

Huang said the chip will be “the engine of the world’s AI infrastructure.” Hopper provides a ninefold improvement in performance over the Ampere architecture, the CEO said.

The company also announced a suite of new and updated AI software tools for speech recognition and translation, recommendation engines, and improved real-time communication including language translation, among other applications.

Nvidia unveiled a computer system for creating “digital twins” of physical worlds called Omniverse, with applications in robotics and industrial automation. The notion of digital twins is to provide digital representations of real-world objects to do testing and development.

Omniverse also provides a new set of tools for the creation of virtual worlds and avatars. The company is launching a cloud service to allow designers to access Omniverse services remotely.

Huang also announced updates to the company’s automated and electric-vehicle platforms, including new agreements with the EV manufacturers BYD (BYDDF)and [Lucid ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/lcid)(LCID) to use the Nvidia Drive platform on next-generation vehicles.

Near midday in New York on Tuesday, Nvidia shares were up 0.7%, to $269.14. The stock has risen almost 27% over the last week, but is off about 8% for the year to date.",tk7hd8,56,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tk7hd8/nvidia_unveils_ai_chips_and_software_plus_tools/

However, adjusted P/E ratios are pushing up against 40 and taking Michael Burry‘s stance on Index Funds into consideration, we might really have completely detached from a reliable price finding mechanism by just blindly pouring money into those indexed companies…

However, there must be a way to find out right? 

A companies valuation should represent the net present value of its future cash flows…

If we would determine the NPV of all companies within a specific index (DJ, or DAX maybe) and compare it to the current market valuation of the Index as a whole, we could easily determine on whether we‘re detached from it‘s true value, right?

1372,No one went broke taking profits,,"PSA. If you are up on a stock, consider locking in some profit. If you don’t, remember there is risk to holding anything. There are lots of volatile stocks moving very quickly in this market. You can see vey fast gains, and also fast losses. Everyone should keep their own goals and risk tolerances in mind but it can be easy to let hype or fomo get to you. So for anyone who needs to hear it, taking profits is a safe and reasonable strategy. Things that went up sharply very well may correct (as we saw with many tickets this year).  You haven’t actually made money until you sell, so think about if it makes sense to take profits, to rebalance or if your current holdings still fit your goals and risk tolerances. 

Good luck out there everyone

Edit: I find it super interesting how aggressive people get at even the insinuation you should consider selling a volatile stock you are currently up on.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

1377,ASML: CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares,Industry News,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members.

I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split.

I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

Is it just a coincidence all these events are happening at the same time?

These are the two etf strategies leading my portfolio rn. I'm hedging primarily with precious metals and commodities, which I'm very bullish on giving the current geopolitical and macro economic environment.

Curious to see what are some of most popular ETFs on r/StockMarket and how you're currently bulletproofing your portfolio.

**Paired Switching S&P 500 and Gold**

A pair of classics: stocks and gold. Together, but apart. This strategy switches between holding stocks and gold depending on their 90-day performance. It holds stocks if stocks are doing better, and gold if gold is doing better.

**Commodity Momentum**

* Metals, timber, agriculture. The building blocks of the physical world. This strategy holds a given commodity if it has positive momentum--if it’s  doing better than medium-term treasury bonds. If not, it’s bonds.

- regulation: EU is becoming increasingly stricter with data protection and cutting up companies, but Googles different businesses could do well on their own as they are mostly not in competition to each other and even with recent regulations Google growth doesn't seem to slow down, plus it's a big holding among us senators which makes me doubt regulation is coming in the US, their biggest market.

- slowing growth/competition: guidance so far is amazing and Googl tends to beat estimates. Competition in search engine, YouTube and other Google applications seem weak, only in cloud computing they are the underdog compared to MSFT and AMAZON, which is a small part of their company.

1382,China Stocks Soar as State Council Vows Support Amid Rout,,"Equities across Hong Kong and China surged after China’s state council vowed to keep its stock market stable amid a historic rout that erased $1.5 trillion in value over the past two sessions.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped as much as 12% on Wednesday, its biggest gain since the global financial crisis, while a gauge of Chinese tech firms listed in Hong Kong soared by a record 20%. China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index advanced by 4%. Some of the most beaten down stocks like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. gained at least 20%.

The eye-watering rally followed a report by the official Xinhua news agency that China will keep the stock market stable and support overseas share listing, citing a meeting chaired by Vice Premier Liu He. The report follows a series of articles by state media in recent days seeking to talk up sentiment. 

Hong Kong's China stock gauge jumps most since 2008 after remarks© Bloomberg Hong Kong's China stock gauge jumps most since 2008 after remarks

Equities in the region have seen intense selling recently amid regulatory fears and speculation that Beijing’s ties with Russia may bring additional U.S. sanctions. Investors had been weighing cheap valuations against lingering risks for tech firms including a possible U.S. delisting of Chinese stocks. A lockdown in tech hub Shenzhen was also weighing on sentiment. 

“Usually the market’s natural bottom comes after the policy bottom, which we are seeing now,” said Li Weiqing, fund manager at JH Investment Management Co. “This time around things may be different, as the rout was looking like a financial crisis; the macro figures are also pointing to a bottom. But even if this is not the end, we can at least expect more stability in the next week or so.” 

Even with the latest bounce, some market watchers say it’s too early to call an end to the rout. JPMorgan Chase & Co. earlier this week labeled some Chinese internet names as “uninvestable” in the short term. 

Meanwhile, short sell turnover in Hong Kong shares accounted for more than 20% of total equity trading on Monday, the highest since late January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 

“Personally I fear that the crisis the market faces is not just about China, it’s a global issue, and not just something that regulators can solve with this,” said Wang Mingxuan, fund manager at Quant Technology Investment. “The calm this bring is just the calm before the storm.”

On the other hand, however, it may encourage risky plays over slow and steady in order to ""win"" the competition (I.E most money after a year/semester = win). If a random kid throws the fake money into a random penny stock that 10x it must be super easy in real life to make money right?

1392,Avoid Stock Moe YouTube and his discord,Opinion,"Everyone is a genius in a bull market. 
It is only now that we can see the true colors of many stock YouTubers. There are many pumpers out there and Stock Moe is one of the worse. 

If anyone wants to join Stock Moe’s discord, consider this:

1) Every stock Stock Moe picks, he will say it is for long term and everything will go up eventually. He will pull up tipranks and a 5 year chart of every stock saying the trend is up. 

2) He never goes in depth into analyzing each company he buys and does not do any kind of technical analysis or charting. Patreons have been asking him to do it but he does not admit that he does not know how. 

3) He swears by NIO and no matter how the price action goes, he keeps buying it and tells his patreons it’s good “long term”. He has gotten his patreons to buy NIO in the 50s and shows no guilt bagging everyone. 

4) He has bought Shib at the top in 2021 and pumped Shib videos everyday saying it will go 6X in 2022 and 80X in 2033. Last week, he sold out all of his Shib at the bottom. 

5) Many of his discord members are still bag holding with more than 50% loss, (NIO, LCID, DKNG, WKHS, SKLZ, SHIB, etc). 

6) He almost never takes profits despite any run up in stocks. He bought CCIV at $18 and when it went to $60 he said he will keep holding and expected it to go $100+, and then it went to $20. Same with MARA, he did not sell at $80 but sold at breakeven because he wanted to buy personal real estate. His portfolio is just for gimmick and does not care about people who follow him. 

7) Stock Moe’s psychotic wife, Mrs. Moe, runs the discord along with some mods. If you ever show any little signs of criticism or questioning in Stock Moe’s stock picks, Mrs. Moe will scold u and write an essay about how she will die defending Stock Moe. She knows nothing about stocks and all she does is create drama even though everyone is just calmly discussing stocks. If you try to defend yourself and explain that you have nothing personal against stock moe, she will still kick you out. Many discord members who are very knowledgeable have gotten kicked out for warning people not to FOMO into Shib. 

They used to be teachers and so they discipline their discord members as if they are kids/students.

Because Mrs Moe has kicked many patreons out, those that are left are mostly noobs who have no idea about investing.",tw9y1s,48,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tw9y1s/avoid_stock_moe_youtube_and_his_discord/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1398,Labor shortage (Boomers retiring) and how it will affect future investments? +Supply chain +Inflation,,"To me the biggest effect of the pandemic is just how many boomers decided to retire and how it’s affecting labor shortage. 

Almost no one wants to take a low wage job since they can work anywhere and can choose. 
Articles claiming trucking companies have a shortage of truck drivers while other articles point to facts about no labor shortage just truckers have their own company/self employed to get better paid. 
And I’ve seen posts in job boards for small business owners looking to hire where people respond saying the wages they want to pay is the same as fast food restaurants. Which of course they’ve had to raised because no one wanted to work there for such low pay.

All that and more seems to be one main issue that now every workers wants to get paid twice as much as before for almost any job. 

So because so many boomers retired and left a bigger supply of all types of jobs, income will raise a lot. Which companies will pass the increases to consumers. Which will then want to get better paid… and keep going on unevenly for a while.


And then we have all the stimulus and the fed ok with low interest rates and a soft landing (or just slow to react). 
So tons of cash=inflation.


And then the more surprising things (or not so much looking back) of supply chain shocks because now people are going back to work, factories at full capacity, restaurants back again, etc.


I feel this labor shortage for low wage jobs is the real kicker. It’s pushing all sort wages up and adding to inflation.
I think maybe a lot of small business will have to close in masses they can’t pay corporate level price increases.

> “Currently, inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks,” she said in prepared remarks. “The Committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.”

> The Fed already has approved one interest rate increase: a 0.25% hike at the March meeting that was the first in more than three years and likely one of many this year.

> In addition, markets expect the Fed to lay out a plan at its May meeting for running down some of the nearly $9 trillion in assets, primarily Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, on its balance sheet. According to Brainard’s Tuesday comments, that process will be swift.

> “The Committee will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting,” she said. “Given that the recovery has been considerably stronger and faster than in the previous cycle, I expect the balance sheet to shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous recovery, with significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017–19.”

> Back then, the Fed allowed $50 billion in proceeds to roll off each month from maturing bonds and reinvested the rest. Market expectations are that the pace could double this time around.

> The moves are in response to inflation running at its fastest pace in 40 years, well above the Fed’s 2% target. Market expectations are for rate increases at each of the remaining six meetings this year, possibly totaling 2.5 percentage points.

1403,Fed Pricing Signals Larger Rate Hike at One of Next Two Meetings,,"
Swaps linked to Federal Reserve policy announcement dates now suggest that around 75 basis points of further rate increases will take place over the coming two meetings, which suggests that at least one move from the central bank will be bigger than the standard size of 25 basis points.

The contract for June suggests an effective fed funds rate of 1.08%, 75 basis points above where the effective rate is likely to be on Thursday after the just-announced 25 basis point increase is factored in. The Fed tends to move in increments of 25-basis-points, which means a 50 basis-point move is being priced wither for May, the next meeting, or June, the one after that.

The prospect that such a supersized increase will take place at the May meeting is around four in five, based on market pricing.

LAS VEGAS — Ford Motor Co., beset by ongoing production woes, told dealers on Saturday it was pushing back allocations and that wholesale deliveries will be lighter until the end of May, although it continues to produce vehicles and fill customer orders.

Ford dealers who attended a make meeting told Automotive News they did not expect new stock allocations until the end of May due to production cuts, although Ford spokesman Said Deep said the company continues “building for both retail and stock.”

That means new-car showrooms that have been nearly empty for months will remain so during what is typically a healthy spring selling season for the industry.

Ford has lost 100,000 units of production due to 37 suppliers failing to provide parts as scheduled, the automaker told dealers in a meeting at the NADA Show here, according to three people present.

The issue has exacerbated Ford's inventory woes that have left most dealership lots bare. Ford said it received 90,000 new-vehicle orders in January and another 72,000 orders in February, suggesting the company remains hampered by a backlog of orders amid production cuts. In February, some 33 percent of the company's U.S. retail sales fulfilled previous customer orders.

Ford executives on Saturday forecast the company's U.S. retail sales in 2022 will be 1.66 million, according to two of the people present. Ford expects to capture 13.3 percent of the U.S. market this year, the two people said, which would be an increase over last year.

The company expects its total U.S. volume to increase this year and projects an increase in global wholesale volume of 10 to 15 percent, a spokesman said in a statement.

Ford's U.S. sales fell 21 percent in February and are off 11 percent year-to-date.",tfwtlb,48,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tfwtlb/ford_delays_dealer_allocations_until_late_may/

1406,Balance Sheet To Be Focus Of Fed Minutes Amid Recession Warnings,,"Shedding light on US central bankers’ hawkish stance, minutes from the Federal Reserve March meeting are expected to reveal a committee leaning towards more aggressive monetary tightening.

Likely to mirror post-meeting rhetoric, the Fed minutes are set to reinforce an urgency to frontload policy and included more details on the balance sheet run-off, according to analysts. 

In March, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by just a quarter point as war raged in Ukraine and domestic inflation hit a four-decade high. Since then, price pressures have only increased, and labour market data has shown solid employment growth and an acceleration in wage growth.

With the Fed pulling no hawkish punches in its policy guidance, investors will scrutinise the minutes for any insights on plans to normalise the balance sheet.

1408,"Companies added 455,000 jobs in March, slightly more than expected, ADP says",Industry News,"Companies added jobs at a solid pace in March,  indicating that hiring is strong despite signs of a tightening labor  market, payroll processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.

Private  payrolls expanded by 455,000 for the month, the firm said, about in line  with the Dow Jones estimate of 450,000 though it was the lowest since  August 2021. The total was slightly below the upwardly revised 486,000  in February, and brought ADP’s first-quarter jobs count to 1.45 million.

The  report comes two days before the more closely watched nonfarm payrolls  report, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics expected to show jobs growth  of 490,000 for the month, according to the Dow Jones consensus  estimate. The ADP and BLS numbers can differ widely, as they did in  February when the payrolls firm’s count was about 200,000 below the  government’s official tally.

ADP’s report for March indicated that  hiring was spread evenly around sectors, with leisure and hospitality  adding 166,000 to lead the way. Education and health services  contributed 72,000 while professional and business services was next  with 61,000 new jobs.

On the goods-producing side, manufacturing led with 54,000 while construction added 15,000.

Service-providing companies added 377,000 jobs while goods producers made up the balance of about 79,000.

By  size, job gains also were spread fairly evenly, with companies  employing 50 to 499 workers up 188,000 and large companies adding  177,000. Small business, which saw a decline in February, reversed that  and added 90,000 in March.

“Businesses  are hiring, specifically among the service providers which had the most  ground to make up due to early pandemic losses,” said Nela Richardson,  chief economist at ADP. “However, a tight labor supply remains an  obstacle for continued growth in consumer-facing industries.”

Indeed, in February there were [a record 5 million more jobs](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/29/there-are-now-a-record-5-million-more-job-openings-than-unemployed-people-in-the-us.html)  than available workers, according to BLS data released Wednesday.  Workers continue to leave their jobs in search of better opportunities,  with 4.3 million more taking part in the so-called Great Resignation  during the month.

Friday’s report is expected to show the unemployment rate contracted further, to 3.7%.

Federal  Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely as the central  bank battles inflation at 40-year highs. Job growth has come with a  sharp acceleration in wages, and the Fed is expected to raise interest  rates at a brisk pace this year to combat rising prices.

1413,Buy Signal - Why Shipping Stocks Declined 5% - 8% today: $ZIM $GOGL $DAC $SBLK,Fundamentals/DD,"This is obviously the news that drove the share price down today.  Although it is aimed at curbing freight costs, it ultimately will have little impact because it ignores the important role of all supply chain participants, including ports, marine terminals, truckers, railroads, and warehouse operators at fixing the supply chain.

This bill will ultimately benefit, and be very bullish, for the more developed, technologically driven, publicly traded, and sophisticated shippers like $ZIM $GOGL $DAC and $SBLK who already comply with the tracking, reporting, and transparency that the bill requires.  

However, the bill will be a nightmare for the privately owned ""giants"" of the shipping industry such as Mediterranean Shipping Company, CMA-CGM, Ocean Network Express, and others (who control more than 40% of the market) and are not bound to the strict reporting and compliance standards as publicly listed companies.

This decline was a knee-jerk reaction investors spooked by the unfamiliar additional regulation.  These shipping stocks will rebound quickly and aggressively once investors have a chance to digest the news, read the bill, and realize that this is a huge opportunity for the well run publicly traded shipping companies to gain market share from the notoriously corrupt private giants.

Reddit is many things: the people’s forum, a repository of the dankest memes, the not-so-secret weapon against Wall Street, and “the front page of the internet”. It might also soon be known as a publicly traded company valued at [$15 billion](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/reddit-files-us-ipo-2021-12-16/). The famed social media platform plans to take itself public sometime this year (possibly as soon as [this month](https://www.barrons.com/articles/reddit-initial-public-offering-ipo-news-51639645252)). Reddit has already filed preliminary IPO registration statements with the SEC and has [engaged Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-07/reddit-is-said-to-tap-morgan-stanley-goldman-sachs-for-ipo?sref=qMIA4tzu) to guide it. 

This potential IPO represents a big moment for a company that has undeniably earned itself a prominent place in the internet zeitgeist. Internet dwellers have long turned to Reddit’s online communities for loosely moderated bonding over shared passions ranging from [tripping acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/) to [admiring the CCP](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZedong/). Over years of playing host to strange worlds of bronies and NSFW video enthusiasts, the platform has contributed much slang to the [pop culture lexicon](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/the-wallstreetbets-glossary-a-field-guide-to-apes-stonks-tendies-AMC-GME-reddit/)*.* But the platform really showed its reach in 2021, when posters on r/WallStreetBets [orchestrated a short squeeze](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/reddit-vs-wall-street-by-the-numbers-one-year-later-wallstreetbets-gamestop-amc-cloverhealth-tesla-blackberry/) of multiple stocks including GameStop and AMC. Until Reddit goes public, the term ""Reddit stock"" refers to securities hyped by retail investors on the platform. The successful effort to stick it to institutional investors sent shockwaves through Wall Street and may have inspired a [DOJ inquiry](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/the-big-short-seller-probe-who-are-the-investors-on-the-dojs-list/) into a number of prominent short sellers.

> For years, Munger led Daily Journal as chairman, in addition to his role as a vice chairman at Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Daily Journal announced in March that the 98-year-old billionaire would step down from that role, but still hold a board seat and “continue to pay particular attention to matters with which he has been involved in the past, including the company’s securities portfolio,” according to a regulatory filing at the time. He also said that he would donate $1 million of his stock in the company to create an equity incentive plan. 

> Daily Journal is known for its collection of papers and for selling software to customers that include justice agencies and courts. The business also holds a collection of stocks in addition to its operating businesses, similar to Berkshire’s strategy of also investing while owning businesses. Its stock portfolio consisted of five different publicly disclosed investments at the end of March, which includes the Alibaba holding that it first started disclosing a year ago.

1425,"I-Bonds - A great alternative to cash, but not a replacement for equities",,"I've seen this subreddit give lots of praise to Series I Savinga Bonds, which, for those who don't know, are bonds offered by the U.S gov which are supposed to track inflation and are currently returning a whopping 7.1% annually. I think this praise is rightfully earned, because this level of risk free nominal return is practically unheard of with traditional fixed income investing.

So as the title states, these bonds are vastly superior to just holding cash in a HYSA, and this is where their praise should stop. But instead, I've seen many contributors to this subreddit replacing their equity exposure with I-Bond holdings stating things like ""7% is practically what you get from stocks, and it's risk free!"". This is flawed thinking, because most of these investors are forgetting that **i-bonds will always target a 0% real return on your investment, while equities investors can expect to earn a non-zero positive real return** (over a long enough time horizon)

It is true that equity exposure comes with uncertainty, but that is exactly why they are also associated with higher expected returns. If you are looking to build your wealth and increase your buying power, I-bonds are guaranteed to NOT accomplish this.

A personal note: I have transitioned a portion of my cash holdings to I-bonds, and have also continued my usual investment schedule through these high inflationary periods.",u0xj7d,39,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u0xj7d/ibonds_a_great_alternative_to_cash_but_not_a/

I am sure I am not the only AT&T stockholder here.   Sorry for the copy n paste.  Important here to note that you will not receive fractional shares of $WBD and receive cash payout 10 days after the split for all fractional $WBD shares. 

If you own AT&T stock at the end of trading on Monday, April 4, you will receive two temporary stocks in addition to your AT&T ""T"" stock before the market opens on Tuesday, April 5. 

The first temporary stock you will receive before the market opens on Tuesday, April 5, is under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ticker symbol ""T WI."" If you sell ""T WI,"" you will be selling only AT&T common stock while retaining the right to receive shares of WBD common stock. 

The second temporary stock you will receive before the market opens on Tuesday, April 5, is under the Nasdaq symbol ""WBDWV."" If you sell ""WBDWV"" you will be selling your right to receive shares of Warner Bros. Discovery common stock while retaining your shares of AT&T common stock. 

AT&T Shareholders may not have very long to decide because the recording date for the new Warner Bros. Discovery shares is at the close of business on Tuesday, April 5. If you do nothing, you will retain your AT&T ""T"" common stock and own Warner Bros. Discovery common stock once the merger is complete.  

After the merger is complete, the temporary stocks ""T WI"" and ""WBDWV"" will cease to exist, and AT&T's ""T"" stock price will adjust lower to reflect the loss of WarnerMedia.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 4th, 2022.

# **Markets will be looking for clues from the Fed ahead, as historically strong month gets underway - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/01/markets-will-be-looking-for-clues-from-the-fed-ahead-as-historically-strong-month-gets-underway.html)**
*****
> The stock market is heading into what promises to be a volatile second quarter, but April is traditionally the best month of the year for stocks.
*****
> The major indices were higher in March, but they turned in a weak performance for the first quarter, the worst since the pandemic. Investors have been worried about rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and inflation, which was made even worse by disruptions in commodities exports from both Russia and Ukraine.
*****
> Stocks are typically higher in April, and it is historically the best month of the year for the S&P 500. The S&P has been higher 70% of the time and has gained an average 1.7% in all Aprils since World War II, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. For all months, the S&P averaged a gain of 0.7%.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 3.6% in March, and Stovall said the rally could continue. “I think we get back to breakeven, but then I wouldn’t be surprised if we go through another pullback or correction before we have an end of year rally,” he said.
*****
> Market focus in the week ahead will remain squarely on developments around the Ukraine war and on the Federal Reserve. The Fed on Wednesday is scheduled to release minutes from its March meeting, where it raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
*****
> There are also a handful of Fed speakers, including Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who speaks Tuesday.
*****
> Greg Faranello, AmeriVet Securities head of U.S. rates, said the Fed minutes could be the highlight of the week since the central bank is likely to provide more detail on its plans to shrink its balance sheet. The Fed has nearly $9 trillion in securities on its balance sheet, and a reduction of those holdings would be another step to tighten policy.
*****
> “The market is curious. They’re going to be looking for some clues in terms of how quickly, how big, what the caps look like,” said Faranello.
*****
> The economic data calendar is light, with factory orders Monday, international trade and ISM services Tuesday and wholesale trade Friday.
*****
> Traders will also be watching for any comments from companies ahead of the first-quarter earnings reporting season, which starts in mid-April.
*****
> “The first-quarter earnings have actually been improving in the last month, so that’s encouraging,” said Stovall.
*****
> # Farewell to first quarter
> The Dow was off 4.6% for the first quarter, while the S&P 500 was down 5%. The worst performer by far was the Nasdaq, down 9.1%. In the past week, stocks were barely changed. The Dow was down 0.1%, while the S&P was up 0.1%. The Nasdaq was up 0.7%.
*****
> Interest rates also moved dramatically during the quarter, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield temporarily touching a high of 2.55% in the past week, after starting the quarter at 1.51%.
*****
> On Friday, the 10-year was yielding 2.37%, while the two-year yield, which most reflects Fed policy, was at 2.45%. The two-year was yielding 0.73% at the beginning of the year.
*****
> Faranello said bond yields can keep going higher on inflation concerns, but they could consolidate before another big move.
*****
> “I think the market is looking for a new catalyst here,” he said. “I just think the first quarter has been about repricing the market, and we’ve done that...The Fed came out very hawkish. We made made a dramatic repricing. Now, we need to see more data to see how this is going to evolve in the second quarter.”
*****
> Stovall said the S&P 500′s first-quarter performance is one of the 15 worst first quarters, going back to 1945. After those weak quarters, down 3.8% or more, the second quarter was better on average. This year’s first-quarter decline was tied with 1994, which had the 12th worst first quarter.
*****
> After those 15 weak first quarters, “we actually climbed 4.8% in the second quarter and rose in price two out of every three times,” he said. But for the full year, the S&P 500 gained just 40% of the time, and was down an average 2% in those years.
*****
> But this year is a midterm election year, and in those years the second and third quarters are typically the weakest. “Of those 15 worst quarters, five of them were midterm election years, and of those five, the second quarter was up an average 1%, and it rose in price only 40% of the time,” Stovall said.
*****
> Stovall said the market could be higher in the second quarter, but it will face headwinds. “Oil prices are likely to remain up. Interest rates are certainly not coming down,” he said, adding geopolitical pressures are likely to remain. “I see the possibility of a 1% gain. We could probably eke out something good.”
*****
> Stocks were held hostage by rising and volatile oil prices in the first quarter, as the world scrambled to make up for Russia’s export barrels. Many customers refused to buy Russian oil for fear of running afoul of financial sanctions on Russia’s financial system.
*****
> After wild swings both higher and lower, West Texas Intermediate oil futures gained 39% in the first quarter, the eighth positive quarter in a row and its best first quarter since 1999. WTI was just under $100 per barrel Friday afternoon.
*****
> # Choppy, volatile market
> Joe Quinlan, head of CIO Market Strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, said he is constructive on the market heading into the second quarter, but he sees some rough spots ahead.
*****
> “We’ve got to work through the inflation problem, and the Fed catching up to the expectations of the market,” Quinlan said. “We’ve got to re-anchor inflation. It’s going to be a choppy, volatile year. We’re tilting more toward hard assets, whether it’s commodities, energy and natural gas.”
*****
> Quinlan said he leans towards equities over fixed income, which has also been unusually volatile. “We’re using equities as a hedge against inflation,” he said. “Within that framework is more hard assets, fuels, agriculture complex in general and metals and minerals.”
*****
> In the second quarter, the stock market will continue to adjust to an aggressive Federal Reserve against the backdrop of what should have been a solid economy. With 431,000 payrolls added in March, jobs data continues to be strong, but there is a fear the Fed will raise interest rates too quickly, derailing the economy and spinning it into recession.
*****
> Traders in the futures market expect the Fed will increase its fire power at its next meeting in early May, hiking interest rates by 50 basis points, or a half-percent. The Fed’s first rate increase was a quarter-point at its March meeting.
*****
> The market is pricing in the equivalent of eight quarter-point hikes, and Treasury yields have moved higher with stunning speed as market expectations for interest rates shifted. The two-year Treasury yield rose above the 10-year yield, or inverted this past week, for the first time since 2019. That is viewed by the market as a warning sign for a recession.
*****
> Fed officials have signaled they want to move to trim the balance sheet soon. Kansas City Fed President Esther George this past week said the Fed’s balance sheet will need to decline significantly. She said the Fed’s holdings of Treasurys may have depressed the 10-year yield, causing the yield curve to invert.
*****
> Faranello said interest rates could still head higher on inflation worries, but rates could consolidate after their recent run higher. The yield curve could also remain inverted.
*****
> “We can stay like this for a year-and-a-half. Everyone’s screaming a recession is coming...I don’t think the yield curve is telling us a recession is just about to happen,” Faranello said.

> # Here Comes the Best Month of the Year

> After one of the worst starts to a year ever for stocks, March has seen a huge bounce. Incredibly, the S&P 500 Index is only about 4% away from new all-time highs. The big question is can the near-term strength continue?

> “The good news is stocks really appear to love April. Not only is it the best month on average since 1950, but it has also been higher an incredible 15 of the past 16 years as well,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 has indeed closed green in April in 15 of the past 16 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blog-3.30.22.png))**

> Taking a deeper look at April reveals that it’s not just the best month for stocks since 1950—it’s also the best month in the past 20 years and the second best month in the past decade. If there is one flaw, it is that in a midterm year it ranks only seventh and is barely positive.

> # Asset Class Performance by Weekday

> As Vladimir Lenin once wrote ""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen."" For investors, each passing day of late has felt like a month, as Powell's Pivot, the Ukrainian conflict, rampant inflation, supply chain constraints, and COVID have caused rapid shifts in investor sentiment, leading to heightened volatility. With each day feeling like an eternity, we decided to look into the average performance by weekday to provide you with insights into trading patterns based on the day of the week.

> The last twelve months have seen a divergence in performance from the norms of the last 30 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, the S&P 500 has performed poorly on Mondays and Tuesdays before gaining steam from Wednesday through Friday. This diverges from the patterns seen over the last thirty years, in which Thursday and Friday struggled relative to the performance over the first three trading days of the week. This year, oil has averaged gains on every day of the week, but the strongest performance has occurred early in the week, which is interesting as Monday and Tuesday have tended to be the worst days of the week for oil over the last 30 years. Bonds have performed poorly in the beginning of the week over the last twelve months but have partially recovered in the last two trading days. Over the long run, the safe asset has traded narrowly with only Wednesdays averaging a loss. Tuesdays and Thursdays have been strong days for the US Dollar over the last twelve months, but these days tend to result in flat to negative performance when looked at over the last 30 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/SPX-daily-chg-by-WD-032822-2.png))**

> Below we summarize the cumulative performance by weekday for the S&P 500 over the last 30 years. As you can see, Tuesday has been the best performing day by far, booking performance gains of 160.5%. Wednesday has posted a cumulative gain of 83.6%, which lands the day in second place. Friday and Thursday have been the weakest days, booking a cumulative gain of just 27.4% and 28.2%, respectively. Monday lands in the middle, recording a cumulative gain of 41.3%. As outlined above, the recent shift in weekday performance deviates from the norms of the last 30 years as investors have come out of the weekend with fears but concluded the week with optimism.

> # Strong Performance at the Tail Ends of Breadth

> While the index turned lower today on weaker breadth, the recent rally for the S&P 500 has come on strong breadth resulting in the 10-day advance/decline line to surge to some of the highest readings on record. Monday and Tuesday saw 99th percentile readings in the 10-day A/D line and even after the decline today, the current reading remains in the 96th percentile. At Monday's high, the 10-day AD line reached the most elevated level since October 2020. On a sector level, in the past week Financials, Health Care, Materials, Real Estate, and Tech also all saw 99th percentile readings in their own 10-day advance-decline lines.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033022-SP-500-AD-Line.png))**

> In the matrix below, we show the average forward performance of the S&P 500 broken down by the percentile range that the index's 10-day AD line is in. Generally, lower readings in the 10-day AD line have been followed by stronger returns whereas higher readings have been followed by weaker returns. That is, except for the most elevated readings. Readings in the upper decile have actually been followed by more consistently positive and stronger than normal average returns for the S&P 500. In other words, strong breadth is typically a more negative signal for the S&P 500 going forward, but an extremely strong breadth reading has actually been positive.

> # Down Q1 Midterm Years & Bear Market Bottoms

> As we enter the last month of the Best Six Months, the market logged its first down quarter in two years since the beginning of the pandemic. Going back to 1930 when our S&P 500 data begins Q1 was positive 55 years and negative 37 times over the 92-year span. Overall, years that advanced in Q1 were up 46 of the 55 years or 83.6% of the time with an average gain of 13.2% for S&P 500. Years when Q1 was down, were positive only 16 of the 37 years or 43.2% of the time for an average loss of -0.1%.

> What jumped out at us were the midterm years that had losing first quarters. In the table we compiled here, the events during these years have an eerie resonance to what’s happening today in 2022. War, conflict, inflation, recession, and rate hikes were common themes in these midterm years. Only three of these 10 midterm years had sizable gains: 1938 (War in Europe), 1942 (WWII) and 1982 (Secular Bull). Losses carried over into Q2 in all but 3 years: 1938, 1942 and 2018. Third quarters rebounded in all but three years: 1966 (Vietnam), 1974 (Oil Embargo/Watergate) and 2002 (Iraq). The only real Q4 blemish was 2018 when the Fed hiked rates too briskly.

> In general, after a down midterm Q1, losses tended to carry over into Q2 and the market began to find its footing in Q3 and rally into Q4. Protracted crises in 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, and 2002 delivered the most negative results though all had significant bear market bottoms. At the Q1 crossroads in 2022 we are faced with similar conditions. Persistent hyperinflation (Jeff’s large iced black coffee is up 29% in the last month from $3.02 to $3.89), a rising rate environment that’s stoking inverted yield curve/recession fears, the brutal war in Ukraine and the new Cold War 2.0 with Russia are threatening a bear market on the backdrop of the heightened volatility we have been warning of since our Annual Forecast in December.

> # Bears Go Back Into Hibernation

> The last couple weeks of the first quarter have seen equities reverse a sizable portion of this year's losses and sentiment has rebounded in sync, though, bullish sentiment turned slightly lower this week in spite of the S&P 500's move higher. From the weekly AAII sentiment survey, bullish sentiment shed 0.9 percentage points coming in at 31.9%. Even after that decline, the current level of reported optimism remains above all others (outside of last week) since early January, but bullish sentiment still would need to rise another 6 percentage points to move back up to its historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While more investors are not reporting much optimism, fewer are outright bearish. Bearish sentiment fell for a second week in a row falling another 7.9 percentage points to 27.5%. With a little over a quarter of respondents reporting as bearish, this sentiment reading is at the lowest level since November. That is also now the biggest two-week decline in bearish sentiment (22.3 percentage points) since November 2009 when it had fallen 23.74 percentage points in a two-week span.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Finally, we would note that given bearish sentiment has plummeted at a historic rate without much of an increase in bullish sentiment, neutral sentiment has picked up the difference. That reading clipped above 40% this week for the highest level since January 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> Other sentiment surveys like the Investors Intelligence one and NAAIM's Exposure Index have also pivoted more bullish this week. As a result, our sentiment composite is close to zero meaning across these three indicators, sentiment is now only just slightly below the historical average.

1429,Bad time to put money into mutual funds?,,"Hello all,

Just looking for some advice about mutual funds. Do you think it’s a bad time to invest in one right now? This is my first time doing any sort of investing or putting my money away. I have finally saved 15,000. I am wondering if the war in Ukraine makes it a bad time for me to put my money into a medium risk mutual fund. My bank tells me that it is not a bad time. However I don’t know a lot about investing or mutual funds. I’m located in Canada B.C if that makes any difference. The gas prices are insane out here right now which is scary.",tozy3h,43,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tozy3h/bad_time_to_put_money_into_mutual_funds/

Published March 30, 2022 By Kyle Jaeger

As federal marijuana banking reform continues to stall in Congress, a Pennsylvania Senate committee on Wednesday approved a bipartisan bill to safeguard banks and insurers against being penalized by state regulators for working with state-legal medical marijuana businesses.

https://www.marijuanamoment.net/pennsylvania-senators-approve-marijuana-banking-protection-bill-as-congressional-reform-stalls/

This has ""curtailed access to conventional banking and insurance services that are essential for operating any business,"" he said. ""Safely banking the state-legal cannabis industry removes a public safety risk and is an opportunity to grow our economy and should ultimately lower costs for medical patients.""",tsqd4d,43,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tsqd4d/pennsylvania_senators_approve_marijuana_banking/

1440,"Majority Of Europeans Support Marijuana Legalization, New International Poll Finds",News,"Support for marijuana legalization in the U.S. has been consistently climbing as more states move to end prohibition—and a new, landmark survey out of Europe shows similar majority support for regulating cannabis in several major countries in the region.

https://www.marijuanamoment.net/majority-of-europeans-support-marijuana-legalization-new-international-poll-finds/

On average across the eight countries, 55 percent said they support legalizing adult-use cannabis, while 25 percent said they oppose it. Eighteen percent said that they weren’t sure.

""We see this polling as significant because it suggests that widespread cannabis reform in Europe is now simply a question of when and how, rather than an ‘if,’” Hanway Associates’s Charlotte Bowyer, a co-author of the report, told Marijuana Moment.

Respondents were also asked about their stance on varying regulatory models for marijuana sales, from traditional commercial retailers that are increasingly common in states across the U.S. to cannabis social clubs where adult members could purchase and consume marijuana on-site.

When all respondents—including those who support and oppose legalization—were asked specifically about whether they favor certain forms of marijuana access, 48 percent said that they back regulated retail stores, 35 percent said they support a non-commercial home grow model and 32 percent said they are in favor of cannabis social clubs.",u2q4hc,44,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/u2q4hc/majority_of_europeans_support_marijuana/

I told them that government bonds would be a good option since they are considered risk-free and wouldn't lose value in a downturn like SPY or VOO. I am also looking at actual government bonds and not a bond etf that could lose value. My question is, how does someone even go about purchasing bonds, and is there a recommended length that people normally purchase (1-year, 2-year, 5 year)?

1458,Investing in the Sports Industry,,"It is possible to invest in sports, although it’s different from investing in other industries like technology, retail, materials, financial institutions, and others.

The main reason?

Only a few big sports organizations are trading in public markets, and unless you have deep pockets and know the right people, it’s unlikely you’ll have any other choice.

For example, you can’t directly invest in the Dallas Cowboys or Tottenham – they’re private companies.

You could buy a team if they get put up for sale, but you’d need a LOT of money.

So, where/how could you invest? What are investments in sports available for the public investor?

# 1. Stocks

The easiest way to invest in sports is by buying shares of publicly traded companies available to the general public through different stock exchanges.

Some examples are:

* **Teams**: Manchester United, New York Knicks, Atlanta Braves, Juventus, Toronto Blue Jays, Borrusia Dortmund, Ferrari
* **Sports Apparel**: Nike, Puma, Lululemon, Adidas
* **Sports Retail & Accessories**: Dicks Sporting Goods, Footlocker
* **Technology:** Peloton, Catapult Sports
* **Media:** Formula 1 (through Liberty Media), The Madison Square Garden Company, ESPN (through Disney), CBS (through Paramount), Fox, Comcast
* **Betting & Entertainment** – Draftkings, the WWE, MGM Resorts, Penn National Gaming, EA Sports

Some advantages of investing in publicly traded companies are high liquidity, relatively low risk, ease of access, and availability of information.

The disadvantages are the limited alternatives and return potential.

# 2. Venture Capital / Early Stage investments

The idea behind venture investing is to find startups developing technology or solutions for the sports industry and invest in them early to help them grow.

Some of the most popular funds that invest in early-stage companies in sports are:

* Elysian Park
* leAD Sports
* Raine Group
* KB Partners
* SeventySix Capital
* Stadia Ventures
* Courtside Ventures

The advantages of investing in VC are high asymmetric return potential and a broad set of alternatives/opportunities in diverse sports sectors.

The disadvantages are the high barrier of entry (i.e., you need more money), low liquidity, high risk, and there isn’t much information on the companies either.

# 3. Private Equity

Private equity firms invest huge amounts of money and have access to diverse investment opportunities related to sports.

Investments here are more distinctive – from funding a specific sporting event, acquiring a stake in clubs and leagues, or even getting a share in media rights deals.

Some PE firms in the space are Arctos Sports, Dyal Capital Partners, RedBird Capital, and Sixth Street.

These investments are even harder to access than VC, but they offer some exciting opportunities in sports to those who can afford them.

# TLDR;

There are a few ways to invest in sports (stocks, VC, PE) that depend on your budget and interest; however – as you probably realized, there are many gaps in the market.

What if you wanted to invest in the future of up-and-coming athletes? What about investments in youth sports teams or leagues? Or sports facilities? Cities hosting Olympics/World Cups?

Blockchain technology is helping with that, but expect new technologies to enable more and different investments in sports to the general public.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

1462,"Redfin bought RentPath for $608m in cash. Since then, Redfin has dropped 84%.",Company Analysis,"This is the definition of a bad deal. The strategy was sound. Redfin wanted to add rentals fast instead of building it from scratch. But the price and the way it paid for RentPath is the reason why I wouldn't invest in Redfin. They don't make good decisions.

Redfin purchased RentPath in an all-cash deal for $608m on Feb 19 when its stock price was $96, an all-time high.  Instead of trying to purchase RentPath with stocks or a combination of stock/cash, it did by using 1/3 of its total cash on hand. Redfin literally bought a real estate company with cash at the **exact peak** of the real estate stock bubble.

At $608m, it was 6% of Redfin's market cap on Feb 19.  Today, Redfin's stock price is $15.73 and has a market cap of 1.67B. This means the price paid for **RentPath is now 39% of Redfin's total market cap**.

RentPath was a company in bankruptcy.

Total insanity.

Now Redfin only has $750m in cash instead of $1.35b while they lost $100m in 2021. We're heading into a prolonged bear real estate market due to rising interest rates. I don't see how Redfin can invest in its tech and continue to grow in the foreseeable future. Layoffs are what I'm guessing or another round of fundraising which will dilute shareholder value.

1465,"2-year Treasury yield tops 10-year rate, a ‘yield curve’ inversion that could signal a recession",Industry Discussion,"The 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields inverted for the first time since 2019 on Thursday, sending a possible warning signal that a recession could be on the horizon.

The bond market phenomenon means the rate of the 2-year note is now higher than the 10-year note yield.

This part of the yield curve is the most closely watched and typically given the most credence by investors that the economy could be heading for a downturn when it inverts. The 2-year to 10-year spread was last in negative territory in 2019, before pandemic lockdowns sent the global economy into a steep recession in early 2020.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.331%, while the yield on the 2-year Treasury was at 2.337% at one point in late trading Thursday. After a brief inversion, both yields were basically trading at the 2.34% level in the latest trading.

1466,"Market Outlook - A Look Ahead for the Week of Mar 28, 2022",Opinion,"**LAST WEEK IN REVIEW**

In last weeks newsletter we discussed how the 200MA on the daily in the SPY could be an area of resistance. Well that selling/resistance did not last long. We had some selling pressure on Wednesday, and buyers stepped up yet again. Early Friday we saw some weakness in a few names, but the OVERALL market decided to push EOD and put in a bullish hammer on the daily and a very bullish hammer on the weekly!

Here is a look at some of the sectors for the last week and how they performed:

https://preview.redd.it/9edkmwgxf0q81.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c106d47d592ecaab105a0c28aa9048eb4b21129

**MARKET OUTLOOK**

The market has had an exceptional run last 2 weeks. Friday we started seeing some weakness but buyers stepped up again! The level to keep an eye on going into this week will be that 452.80-452 level. If we can maintain above this level, we could look to retest the next big resistance areas sitting at around 458.20 which was the double top dating back to Feb 2/Feb 9. The longer we stay above the 200MA, the more people that feel like they “missed the bottom” will start chasing these levels and drive the market slightly higher. If this does happen, pushes to 465/470 is not far off. However, if we reject the 453/458 we could look to pull back some and possible retest that 447/445 level!

QQQ however did under perform slightly on Friday, and on the broad spectrum of things, the Q’s are under the 200MA. The key level to watch is that 361/362 level on Q’s. If we can maintain a good push with increased volume here, then we could look to retest the 200MA sitting at around 368 and possibly get to 370. If we reject that 362 level, then we could look to roll back over and retest the 350s before attempting another move!

1468,"Space related stocks: ASTR, RKLB, ASTS",Industry Discussion,"Hello all. I have been taking advantage of the recent pull backs to initiate a space position. Surprisingly so have found few recent discussions including ASTR and they have had some new catalysts so I’m hoping to get others thoughts here. Disclosure: I am long ASTR and I’m considering going long RKLB and ASTS. 

ASTR had a wild week! Many are aware that ASTR had a failure in their last launch attempt which resulted in the price falling to below $3 briefly. ASTR was able to rapidly identify the cause, fix it and attempt to fly again. That tells me they have built the important process improvement mechanisms internally to iterate rapidly successfully. ASTR had a successful return to flight on Tuesday BUT the rocket lost connection right before the payloads were to be deployed. This was eerily similar to the last failure which occurred at a similar time in the launch and caused enough people to freak out to cause an over 20% drop and then mostly recover when successful deployment of all satellites was confirmed although trading was halted for volatility briefly. Then on Thursday ASTR delayed earnings release to 3/31 which caused a further 6% drop. 

Today the CEO interviewed on CNBC and provided clarification on a number of points. The loss of signal was simply due to the launch angle and lack of radio antennas in the Pacific Ocean. It would have been helpful if they had informed everyone of that expected event beforehand, but oh well. The earnings release date change was due to a change in reporting status but he reiterated a positive outlook. Lastly he touched on the increased demand the launch industry will see due to Russia exiting the market. He also claimed ASTR is making a rocket a month currently. ASTR closed up nearly 14% today. 

ASTR up to recently has been significantly shorted. According to Fintel there is a 23.07% short interest and 40.37% off exchange short volume. 

ASTR will likely benefit enormously from the Russian conflict. In addition to customers needing rides that they can’t use in Russia, the military may significantly increase their use. The US Space Force was one of ASTR’s first customers. The ability to launch from nearly anywhere to any orbit on short notice provides the military with options that no one else can meet. ASTR also is planning on a point-to-point system for Rocket 4. The ability to get a small payload anywhere in the world in 90 minutes may provide a significant market. It’s essentially the same Rocket 3 they are making with a modified second stage so the cost to develop shouldn’t be crazy high.

The earnings call provides an opportunity for significant positive catalysts that might trigger reinforcements higher from the open short positions. There are planned launches monthly for the next few months. Of course a failure would be a significant negative catalyst. 

Why is ASTR still off prior highs in the 12-15 range? They had multiple failures in 2021 as well as multiple lawsuits alleging that capabilities and market size presented were false. 

ASTR closed at $4.60 and I plan to continue to go long via calls. Baring a failure in the near future, ASTR seems poised to enjoy high demand for service while decreasing costs. 

I have followed RKLB as a space enthusiast but I am planning on initiating a position. Most discussions I have read have compared RKLB and ASTR as an either or and I now believe that is false. As SpaceX moves into starship RKLB will expand into near American Broomstick 9 size payloads. RKLB’s Neutron seems well positioned to be significantly less expensive than Falcon 9 and able to launch 80% of the payloads currently flying on the American Broomstick. With ASTR able to launch cheaper than Electron I believe both will evolve into their own markets and complement each other. RKLB has recently developed a new lightweight highly efficient solar panel that is radiation hardened. Diversifying income into supplying solar panels seems like an excellent earnings center. 

ASTS is developing a space based cell phone system intended to supplement terrestrial systems. Assuming the technology will work then the success will depend on funding and execution. ASTS has major backing from current networks and one would assume they are committed to building out such a network. Execution recently received a thumbs up when the company secured multiple launches with SpaceX through 2024. With Soyuz off the market demand will exceed capacity for awhile, but ASTS secured their rides. The upside for such a network is limitless, and with war in Europe raging the need for satellite access for citizens is desperately clear. 

I believe all three companies complement each other well. ASTR is a high beta play with a beta at 2.14. This elevation, however reflects a launch failure that has now been corrected and a return to flight conducted. If my thesis for these companies is true, then the upswing in stock price will be significant. If I am wrong there will likely be violent share erosion. For these reasons I have chosen to use longer dated OTM call options. 

This is my first review. I hope you found this helpful and I invite feedback.",thnfwo,36,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/thnfwo/space_related_stocks_astr_rklb_asts/
1469,"Taking advantage of bottoms, discussion",Industry Discussion,"For many reasons, I think this recent pull back from ATH (just over -20%) is over. CQQQ bottomed and was oversold even on the monthly and weekly time frames as the Chinese market saw major capitulation and an impressive initial bounce, not too dissimilar from the 2008-9 bottom. QQQ SPY and many major stocks were/are all over sold on the longer time frames, and it’s March. Check out March of 2020 and 2009, tax season, perfect time for there to be a rally, but that’s more of a coincidence. That said I’m still prepared for the possibility of a dead cat bounce as we still haven’t gotten technical confirmation, technically. 

REGARDLESS, here’s my question:

IF this is the bottom of the pull back and we begin a rally here to potentially new ATHs, I want to take the utmost advantage of this opportunity. 

1) which sector/industry and which specific stocks do you think will have the biggest recovery IF this is the end of the pull back (and why)?

2) what’s the best way to act on that belief to maximise returns, ie, scaling into leaps or swing trades? Please do share your strategy

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1472,FAAN(M)G valuations by 'value investors'.,Industry Discussion,"Over the last couple years I got some good laughs at 'value' investors looking at the books of companies like GOOG/L and coming to a fair price that was often roughly 2/3rds of the current price, e.g. GOOG/L coming in at $2K when it was selling at $3K.

I'd scoff and mentally comment that I'm glad I didn't listen to this goofball back when I bought GOOG at $1500 - and they were saying to not pay a penny over $1K.

But as we enter a whole new world of an extended 'unfriendly Federal Reserve' - the likes of which we possibly haven't seen since the premiums on FAAN(M)G stocks were added...

Is it now time to give these goofballs a second listen?

1473,"Fed must ‘inflict more losses’ on stock-market investors to tame inflation, says former central banker",Resources,"That’s William Dudley, the former president of the powerful New York Fed, arguing in a guest column at Bloomberg that his former colleagues won’t get a handle on inflation that’s running at around a 40-year high unless they make investors suffer.

There are myriad uncertainties the Fed must navigate, he acknowledged, including the effect of easing supply-chain disruptions and a historically tight labor market. But the effects of the Fed’s tightening of monetary policy on financial conditions — and the the effect that tightening will have on economic activity — is one of the biggest unknowns, Dudley wrote.

Unlike many other economies, the U.S. doesn’t respond directly to changes in short-term interest rates, Dudley said, partly because most U.S. home buyers have long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. But many U.S. households, also in contrast to other countries, have a significant amount of their wealth in equities, which makes them sensitive to financial conditions.

Dudley’s call for the Fed to inflict losses on investors stands in contrast to the longstanding notion of a figurative Fed put, the idea that the central bank would halt monetary tightening or otherwise ride to the rescue in the event of heavy losses in financial markets. Dudley, who ran the New York Fed from 2009 to 2018, was previously chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs and is now a senior research scholar at Princeton University’s Center for Economic Policy Studies.

Will it increase by another 1.5% over the course of 3 to 4 months or will it increase at a slower rate or not at all? I know this is tied to the 10-year treasury note. 

What I'm confused on is how the Treasury note will affect the 30-year fixed rate loan during the next rate hike?

It’s current P/E is 2.00 in an industry that usually trades with a P/E of 4.65 with some of the biggest names all above 5.0.  Historically this industry has traded at a P/E of 16.1 but it’s not expected that these shipping container rates will stay sky high for the next 5 years (more like 1-2) so some of that long term expectation is being accounted for. Regardless ZIM is undervalued and growing faster than it’s peers as next quarters earnings expectations show. In early May ZIM is expecting earnings per share of 12.54 vs last years 5.17 for an yoy earnings growth of 143%.

I expect this stock to flirt with $100 by next ER and should break $120 this year. Add to that some juicy dividends along the way and this is a nice stock to jump into. Let’s all make some money.

1487,is this a bear case for oil.,,"Russia is offering India Ural grade oil at $35 per barrel and it's unlikely that the US will be able to sanction India for buying Russian oil if it can't prevent Europe from buy Russian gas.

India is one of the world's largest importers of oil. It produces less than 20% of the oil it consumes and last year imported just 2% from Russia.  In 2021, the US was among it's biggest suppliers. With Brent at $100+ in 2022, it seems like a no brianer to me that India will increase it's consumption of $30 Ural oil while reducing it's purchases of Brent.

At 4.5 million barrels a day, if India substitutes just 10% of their consumption of Brent with Ural that would add half a million barrels of oil back in the western markets.

Expanding the case to China which imports 7.5 million barrels of oil mainly from The Saudis and Russia. Again at $35 it would be unlikely that China won't substitute Arab Light with Ural. Again as a base case China taking in additional 10% would put 750k barrels of OPEC oil back on the market.

On a high level,   I see one clear difference between the gas crisis of the 70s and vs today. There isn't actually a lack of oil.  The supply chain issue combined with sanctions has created an inefficiently in the market but this will eventually even out as state actors with leverage take advantage of the arb.

1488,Upcoming Merger between Discovery & Warner bros DD,Company Analysis,"Hello r/stocks community members,

I want to pitch you guys with an investment opportunity. But please remember to do your own due diligence. Let me know if I've gotten anything wrong. I want to avoid providing a biased pitch, so I'd shy from giving my assumptions.

Ok, here we go.

* Discovery is merging with Warner bros, which is set to close Q2 2022. We don't know the date, but has already obtained all anti-trust and regulatory authority approvals.
* Discovery Warner bro joint company is set to generate $52bn revenue on pro forma basis, which puts it the number #1 streaming platform compared to $NFLX & $DIS.
* Discovery is a profitable yet boring company. Sure, many of you have come across very profitable companies with declining future profitability prospects therefore depressed valuations e.g., Altria, KHC, KO, etc.
* Discovery generates approximately $2bn in free cash flow at $14bn valuation. Growing revenue and cost at GDP and work backward on a DCF model, market implied perpetual growth rate is only -1%. Yes, the market is pricing the company in steady decline for -1% every year despite the company generated 14% top line improvement last year.
* Discovery and Warner bros merger will create the deepest library content for streaming platform in the market. Management already said the joint company will join their streaming application into one, meaning combining IPs such as Suicide Squad, Peace maker, Food channel, etc.
* Discovery is also one of the very few streaming platform offering sports entertainment including NHL, NCAA, Olympics, etc.
* Qualitative aside. Let's talk valuations. The company is currently trading 1x 2023 forward EV/Sales compared to 2.5x $DIS and 4.5x $NFLX.
* A slight multiple re-rate to 2x on pro forma basis already brings your investment 2x at today's valuation. I know I said no assumptions for me, but if I have to give my target, I have a rule of thumb for top contender trading 75% of market leader multiple, so that's roughly 3.3x. Or if worst case scenario, if it just trades close but lower to $DIS, you still get over 100% return on the investment. This is one of the least followed company on Fitwit and I believe there are some mispricing remains.
* Two reasons why the mis-pricing exist today. 1) there's still no set date on merger schedule despite approvals have been obtained from regulatory body and the board. 2) Discovery has yet to provide on post merger share translation information. There's a very informative article on Seeking alpha by Livy research that gives an estimate on a likely scenario on shares translation on the joint company. I will refrain from providing link because there's a rule against seeking alpha on reddit (I think?).

Let me know if I'm missing anything guys. I've been following event driven opportunities for sometime, and this is one of the wildest underprice pre merger opportunity just yet.

Thank you all for reading. Let me know your thoughts in the comments, and happy trading. Thanks.",tmmc4y,34,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tmmc4y/upcoming_merger_between_discovery_warner_bros_dd/

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

One PUT example is, Simplex Trading on 2/23, has a PUT position of 4mil shares, and are currently down -85%, if they close their position or it expire worthless, will this bump AMC price up?

&#x200B;

One Short position example is JPMORG 2/25 has a short position of 157,000 around 17 dollars, and are down -36% (but i believe they are down 80% as of right now) so they are paying daily margin interest, short borrowing fee correct?

1504,Hedge against potential recession / stagflation. DD.,,"Background: Well, we all know this but the recent economic data is mixed at best. Although it seems that the economy is booming, there's also a lot of risk factors. Moreover, stock market performance isn't always tightly correlated to the market i.e. USA economy grew quite a bit from 2000-2010 but looking at the stock market you wouldn't exactly guess that. Moreover the [schiller ratio is high](https://www.google.com/search?q=themotleyfool+schiller+ratio&rlz=1C1GCEU_enAE883AE884&oq=themotleyfool+schiller+ratio&aqs=chrome..69i57.8144j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) even with the current bear market/correction. Volatile energy markets present a difficult challenge, and a chance to further shake up, already damaged due to the pandemic but slowly recovering, global supply chains. 

Assumptions: Although history doesn't repeat itself, it does rhyme. This recession won't be very different from the ones experienced in the past. So let's assume that this recession won't be different from the previous ones. Meaning that in the long term, DCA will be a good strategy. Buying the dip will be worth it. And that spare cash / cash flow at the lowest points of the market will be amazing long term.

Risk factor of the assumptions: Just to play the devil's advocate, the rise of China and the shrinking economic pie of the USA is, at least in my opinion, why this recession might be different to the previous ones. This recession, if significant, can change the world order. Now, not to be dramatic, but world orders do change , previously mostly because of wars (like when USA became the hegemon after the disastrous world wars in Europe), but this time the Pandemic, the war in Ukraine (which can lead a lot of countries like Russia to start using Chinese swift or currency as the reserve currency) can be deciding factors. Is this certain? No, but it is a risk factor in the assumptions. That doesn't mean that the US stock market won't recover, but that the insane explosion of the stock market that USA experienced in the 20th century, in large parts funded by the USD being the reserve currency for the rest of the world as the result of Bretton-Woods agreement, might be enjoyed by China this time.

Strategies:

Below are my 4 strategies. Main goal is DCA through DRIP and contributions. I generally aim to strike a balance between them all, but I still have a lot of growth stocks left, but I'll try to rebalance my portfolio into roughly equal parts with the new cash flow.

A. [The famous quad-fecta covered call income portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/qyldgang/comments/ncp0bl/quadfecta_covered_call_income_portfolio_analysis/). I do not see the the point of writing too much about this because there's some amazing DD done on the original post. I'll just add this as there seems to be some confusion about this, in my understanding unlike dividend stocks that give you dividends per share, covered call ETFs give you dividends as the percentage of the fund, therefore during the recession - the lower the NAV of the fund, the lower is the dividend. However, having a steady stream of monthly cash from dividends will help you catch the bottom

B. Dividend Stocks & ETFs

NOBL-  is the ETF tracking the so-called Dividend Aristocrats, basically the companies that have increased their dividends at least once per year for at least 25 consecutive years. Unfortunately dividends are at an all-time low right now simply because the P/E ratios are so high. NOBL yields about 2.5% per year. The point of this fund is to have the same income per share no matter what market conditions. Companies like Coca Cola (KO) have held their dividend steady for at least 60 years iirc, so if they could weather previous market downturns, they can weather this too. 

TROW - T. Rowe Price a large mutli-services financial services company with $1.5 trillion AUM. They're dividend aristocrat with a long and storied history. Their P/E is at about 10 right now, which is below the liked of Black Rock (18x) Charles Schwabb (30x) State Street (11.6x). They also yield the highest dividend of the ones listed above, about 3.5% right now. They're also down about 35% from the highs. I've searched far and wide to see if they have some sort of massive problems that are dragging down their shares, but the conclusion I've come is that they are quite invested into growth companies that have been in recession which is dragging them down, however their financials and their future is not in any jeopardy at this point and they look very stable and close to value territory.

ABBV - Abbvie, a health pharma company that specializes in branded drugs. Spun off from Abbot Labs in 2012. Some count them as a dividend aristocrat by counting their shared past with Abbot. They actually have an amazing and growing financial sheets. YTD while the market was in correction territory they grew 14%, and the best part? They still yield above 3% per year. Pharma is an inelastic good, although people might prefer to use generic drug during an economic downturn. Also important to note that they're expensive with a 23x P/E ratio. That being said, their 25% net profit margin that's still growing and the 3.5% yield is enough to sway me.

BTI - British American Tobacco company. Currently yielding above 7% per year. Nicotine is quite an inelastic good that is generally not affected much by recessions, if at all. Of course, there are also moral aspects to consider, but this post is not about that. BTI is heavily involved into smokeless nicotine products like VUSE, which are rapidly growing, and they're a very profitable company (about 26.6% net profit margin)

SCHD - A value fund from Charles-Schwabb. Pays monthly dividend, in total about 3.5% pa

A few other ideas: Not invested yet, O (realty Income), Shell, SPHD, SBUX, HD

C. Growth stocks:

A lot so-called hype companies are more than just hype. Right now might not be the best to invest into them, but I think a lot of them have very high potential and be worth a lot more in the future, therefore I'm buying the dip. Here's the list of the ones I have:

FUBO, NIO, PLTR, PSYK, SGHC

DD on these companies are popular on a lot of reddit forums therefore I will not write much about them

D. Global investments:

Although not invested yet, this will be my next move.

JGGI -  JpMorgan Global Growth & income PLC. I like everything about this fund. Large name association, Global diversified portfolio, low P/E (5x), high dividend (3.5%), stable NAV Growth (44% in 5 years). 

ACWU - MSCI iShares fund that invests mostly in EAFE stocks without USA. 2.9% yield + stable growth 46% in 5 years.

I'll be researching more into Global Markets to diversify the risk, however would be happy to hear get some recommendations on Global Markets and anything else I mentioned in my post.

1505,What types of investments can i make with $300 a month?,,"Hey all!   
Im turning 30yo and after getting spooked by some health related issues, it made me realize i need a safety net just in case.  
I've been reading and watching videos, but theres so much content about ""doing it the right way"" that i got stuck not knowing how to properly start.

I'm looking for something that's relatively safe and could grow with time so if i need to take care of my health i wont go bankrupt, or being able to retire/open a business down the line in case everything goes fine. 

Right now i have some money set aside but am a bit scared to take it from the bank (as it generates a small passive income) But i can reliably invest about $300 bucks a month into something to make it grow.

What can i do with $300 a month, and what would be a beginners friendly / safe investment that could snowball ?

1512,What Do You Actually Like Going Forward?,Advice,"So. I’ve literally held every stock I own thru this recent downturn in the market (the last 4 days have been awesome though and I’m still way up).

I’ve come to a conclusion about the market, and various subs on Reddit however, and have noticed the following: 

1) Interest rates are going up and will continue to go up this year. This is also not 2017 when interest rates were at their lowest level. As a result, tech stocks took somewhat of a beating when the announcement happened, but then literally an hour later started to rebound (possibly the biggest pricing in I’ve ever seen). So. With the idea that interest rates and tech are correlated, do we still like Apple, Microsoft, etc?

2) Covid. It seems that this issue is getting better in every part of the world (maybe minus China who are going thru an outbreak). I am a Canadian myself, so when Trudeau made the announcement that restrictions are going to ease in the travel sector, I would hope that airlines are going to inch upward. Also. Presumably. The supply chain will improve as people return to work, supply lines become better improved and unemployment decreases. With this in mind, do we like airlines, cruise lines, shipping companies?

3) The war. As a result of Putin’s bright ideas, he has single handily sunk his country’s economy. But this has also created massive waves in the global economy as we don’t really know how crazy this guy is. It seems that peace talks are happening, which I believe definitely affect the market. But then if the war ends, so what? What stocks are actually going to directly benefit?

I guess my point in writing all of this is my main question, so what? Are we now out of the tech era? Do we settle into well established ETF’s with dividends? I’m curious as to what people like moving forward, and their general outlook on specific stocks in the next 2 years.",thdp1f,33,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/thdp1f/what_do_you_actually_like_going_forward/

Also assume that one already has other plays like value, oil, etc.  e.g. I am not asking if these stocks are overpriced and if we should instead buy CVX or HAL, etc.

NVDA has AI, which appears to still be at an early stage and has unrealized potential.  However, it is unclear how much of that potential is real and how much is hype.  If we get a bear market, NVDA will drop but might come back once the AI potential is realized, especially if the AI is needed for the event triggering the bear market (e.g. making smart weapons to combat Russia, accelerating green technologies to combat climate change, etc.).

GOOGL also has AI and some other plays like Waymo, but GOOGL remains mostly advertising.  If we do get a recession or a bear market, GOOGL could get hit hard and might also be slower to recover.

MSFT seems the most stable of the three, but I'm not sure if the growth will be as high going forward.  Seems like most businesses already use Office and while MSFT could raise the price, there does not appear to be as much expansion in terms of brand new accounts.

1522,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 4, 2022",Recap/Watchlist," 

**Psycho’s Market Recap - Monday, April 4, 2022**

US stocks firmly rose on Monday as market participants digested the potential for more sanctions against Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine and ongoing concerns surrounding inflation and a more hawkish Federal Reserve. The price of crude oil resumed its march higher, climbing roughly 4% to hover around $104 per barrel.

**Markets Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.86%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +2.06%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.35%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.16%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.40%
* Twitter (TWTR): +27.12%
* Digital World Acq (DWAC): -9.98%
* Apple (AAPL): +2.37%
* Meta Platforms (FB): +4.02%
* Tesla (TSLA): +5.61%
* Shopify (SHOP): +4.95%
* Constellation Brands (STZ): +16.40%
* Futu Holdings (FUTU): +19.34%

In geopolitical news, the US and European Union are considering its next set of punitive sanctions against Russia following their illegal invasion of Ukraine as accusations and evidence that war crimes were committed by Russia grow. The discovery of a mass grave and bodies shot at close range in Bucha, outside Kyiv, a town Ukrainian forces reclaimed from Russian troops, looked set to galvanize the United States and Europe into imposing additional sanctions against Moscow. 

In a [statement](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/04/04/ukraine-declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-on-russian-atrocities-committed-in-bucha-and-other-ukrainian-towns/) on behalf of the 27-nation bloc, Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief foreign envoy, blamed the occupying Russian forces for the massacre and said the EU will work on further sanctions “as a matter of urgency.”

Some major European officials including [Germany's defense minister said they would support banning Russian natural gas](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-must-pay-war-crimes-133730301.html) — a move previously excluded from sanctions as Russia supplies about 40% of Europe's gas energy.

In his widely read annual shareholder letter, JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon pointed to Russia’s war in Ukraine as one of the three fundamental risks to the economic outlook. The other two were “the dramatic stimulus-fueled recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic” and “the likely need for rapidly raising rates and the required reversal of QE easing \[quantitative easing\] by the Federal Reserve.” 

Dimon said, “We do not know what its outcome ultimately will be, but the hostilities in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia are already having a substantial economic impact. They have roiled global oil, commodity and agricultural markets. Our economists currently think that the euro area, highly dependent on Russia for oil and gas, will see GDP growth of roughly 2% in 2022, instead of the elevated 4.5% pace we had expected just six weeks ago. By contrast, they expect the U.S. economy to advance roughly 2.5% versus a previously estimated 3%.""

Last week, concerns over elevated inflation and geopolitical risks were further exacerbated by the brief inversion of the yield curve. A key part of the US Treasury yield is the spread, or difference, between the 10-year and 2-year yields. This spread briefly inverted, meaning the yield on the 2-year note was higher than that of the benchmark 10-year yield. [A yield curve inversion has a history of predicting a recession](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/yield-curve.asp#:~:text=The%20slope%20of%20the%20yield,about%20economic%20activity%20and%20inflation.), with each of the last eight recessions dating back to 1969 preceded by a yield curve inversion. The 2-year, 10-year spread briefly fell as low as minus 0.03 of a basis point, before bouncing back above zero to 5 basis points, according to data by Refinitiv.

In other news, shares of Twitter (TWTR) surged over 25% after Tesla CEO Elon Musk disclosed a 9.2% stake in the company, making him the largest, individual shareholder in the company. Very interesting, given last week he sent a poll asking if Twitter adheres to “the principle of free speech”.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Meta Platforms (FB) gained nearly 4% Monday afternoon as technology and growth stocks broadly recovered. The gain put the stock on track to close above its 50-day moving average — a closely watched technical indicator — for the first time since January.

1523,Magic formula by Joel Greenblat,Resources,"I just read the ""The little book that beats the market"" by Joel Greenblat and wanted to see if anyone in this sub is employeeing or has employeed the investment strategy suggested in the book. 

The idea stipulated is quite simple: ""buy good companies at a bargain"". While the logic seems sound the execution suggested is even simpler which I will try to summarize below for anyone who is interested.

The main point of this strategy is that it only works if applied in a long period of time, aka 5 years +. The author presents a case that this strategy has consistently beaten the average market results for the past 17 years and thinking about the logic he is employeeing it sounds rational. 

The main caveat for me is the application of the formula and how consistent one can be when applying it to actual numbers, so that's why I wanted to ask if anyone around here has read/used/is using the suggested method and what are your thoughts.

Also if you have used the method what were the sources you employed did you do your own research or did you use sources presented in the book.

Here is a brief summary of the strategy:

1. Look for good comapnies by selecting businesses with a high return on capital, the simple formula here is EBIT/(net working capital + net fixed assets). 

2. Look for businesses with a high earning yield, the simple formula here is EBIT/EV (enterprise value).

3. Rank potential companies according to these two criteria, add those critiria to recieve your final ranking and select the best 20 - 30 companies. Hold them for a year, afterwords sell and repeat. 

That's pretty much it. I did cut some corners to briefly explain the idea of course, the book goes into slighlty more detail and gives an explanation to why theses specific inputs are used, but nevertheless the idea stands: good companies at a bargain.

Once more I'd love to hear your thoughts.",tswznl,28,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tswznl/magic_formula_by_joel_greenblat/

# **Investors come off a strong week looking for more gains now that they have some clarity from the Fed - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/18/investors-come-off-a-strong-week-looking-for-more-gains-now-that-they-have-some-clarity-from-the-fed.html)**
*****
> With the Federal Reserve’s first rate hike out of the way, market pros are now debating whether the market can continue the upswing it started in the past week.
*****
> A powerful rally in technology and growth stocks helped drive the stock market higher in its best week of the year. The S&P 500 was up about 6.2% for the week, ending at 4,463. The Nasdaq was up 8.2%, and the Dow gained 5.5%.
*****
> Consumer discretionary stocks gained more than 9% as the top performing sector, followed by technology, up about 7.8%. Energy was the only major sector to decline, falling 3.6%.
*****
> Some of the names that had been most punished like airlines, were among the biggest winners on the week. Airlines were up about 14.7% for the week. High growth names also bounced, with the ARK Innovation Fund, a poster child for growth, jumping about 17.4%. The fund is still down more than 46% over the last six months.
*****
> Ukraine will continue to be a focus, and headlines could continue to create volatility in the coming week. Investors are also watching the course of Covid, which is causing shutdowns of Chinese cities and is spreading again at a higher rate in Europe.
*****
> There are more than a dozen Fed speeches, including from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who appears at an economics conference Monday and at an international banking conference Wednesday. The economic calendar is relatively light, with durable goods and both services and manufacturing PMI released Thursday.
*****
> “The anticipation of the first rate hike did more damage than the rate hike itself. We got ourselves twisted in a knot, starting in December, with the Fed pivot from transitory inflation to tapering” [bond purchases], said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “That’s kind of behind us now as a headwind. That diminishes the impact that any parade of Fed speakers will deliver.”
*****
> The market indeed ignored hawkish comments Friday from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who appeared on CNBC. Both said they want to raise rates faster than the median seven hikes the Fed expects this year.
*****
> The Fed released its interest rate forecast Wednesday, when it raised its fed funds target rate range by a quarter point to 0.25% to 0.50%, its first rate hike since 2018. The Fed also said it would look to start reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet at an upcoming meeting.
*****
> Tech and growth did well in the past week, and they are the stock groups most hurt by higher interest rates. They typically command higher prices because investors buy them for their future earnings, and easy money makes them very attractive.
*****
> Strategists say tech can continue to gain in a rising rate environment, now that some of the excesses are wrung out of the group. But they may not be the leaders they once were.
*****
> # Looking past the Fed
> “I think the stage has been set by the Fed for investors to focus on earnings again,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities, derivatives and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI. “Bottom line...earnings estimates since the beginning of the year have risen.”
*****
> Emanuel said he expects the market could continue to rise in the near term, barring an escalation of geopolitical events. While it appears oil prices may have peaked, he said it is still not clear whether stocks put in the low for the year.
*****
> “Sentiment is absolutely horrendous...You put it all together, and we just think it’s a recipe for higher share prices looking out over the next month or two,” Emanuel said. He said investors are now able to discount the fact the Fed has begun its rate hiking cycle.
*****
> “We’re there. We know what’s going to happen. We know they’re going to do 0.25% in May. We know they’re going to start QT [quantitative tightening] some time at mid-year,” he said. “They’re not raising rates enough that it’s really going to hurt the market and investors can focus on earnings again.” He expects S&P 500 profits to be up 9.3% this year.
*****
> Hogan said the market is leaning towards a favorable outcome for Ukraine, such as a cease fire, although no developments suggest an end is now in sight.
*****
> “Everyone is leaning in this direction that this will come to an end in weeks rather than months,” he said. “If not, the market is going to have to recalibrate that.”
*****
> # This is what the stock charts say
> Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, focuses on the short-term technicals of the market, and he said after a strong run, the market could digest some of its gains early in the week.
*****
> “After an impressive week like this, most active traders are reducing risk into this [S&P 500] 4,400 level, not adding to it,” said Redler. “If we could digest a day or two after quadruple witching that might give us some signals that this could continue towards 4,600.” The quadruple expiration of options and futures was Friday.
*****
> Redler said Russia’s war in Ukraine and Fed policy tightening will continue to hang over the market, and that might keep the S&P 500 in a range. “I don’t think anyone is thinking the market goes right back to all-time highs anytime soon,” he said. “I think we’re smack in the middle of a range. This is a very neutral spot not to get short and not to add to longs. We’ll see how we digest this next week. For me, I think oil put the high in for the year, and that could be helpful.”
*****
> Oil briefly popped to $130.50 per barrel earlier this month, when investors feared sanctions on Russia would restrict its oil exports and create major shortages. Since then oil has fallen back, and West Texas Intermediate crude futures were trading just under $105 per barrel Friday.
*****
> Redler said an important test for the S&P 500 will be to see if it can hold the top third of its range and stay above 4,330. “It if can hold that, the next move could be higher,” he said. “That would show commitment to this week’s actions.”
*****
> Technology shares made a strong comeback, and Redler said he is watching to see if they continue to lead. “Tesla helped lead the way all week. A bunch of tech names did break their downtrends,” he said. “Tesla, NVIDIA and Amazon have been buyable on dips...NVIDIA gave clues that the bounce was as believable as it because it was one of the first stocks to cross its downtrend line.”
*****
> Apple and Microsoft, both higher on the week, could be important drivers of the market in the coming week.
*****
> “Apple and Microsoft haven’t been a headwind but they weren’t a tailwind. If they could outperform a little bit, they could help the broader indices,” Redler said. He said the two stocks, the biggest by market cap, were higher on the week, but they lagged the Nasdaq’s gains because they had they had large sell imbalances during the quadruple witching expiration.
*****
> “The stocks with the biggest buybacks have the biggest selling imbalances,” Redler said.

> # Beware the Ides of March

> On the eve of the Ides of March DJIA registered an ominous 6thDown Friday/Down Monday of 2022 – emblematic of the entrenched downtrend and headline risk from the war, the Fed and inflation. The bulls are clearly on the run. But we can find some solace in the fact that support around the February 24 intraday lows held up again today. Though that support is admittedly tenuous. The next level of support is down near the March 2021 lows around DJIA 31000, S&P 3875, NASDAQ 12500, NDX 13000. Russell 2000 seems to be finding support above 1900.

> Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to “beware the Ides of March” but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. March is a volatile time for the market. It is the end of the first quarter, which brings with it Triple Witching and an abundance of portfolio maneuvers from The Street. And those maneuvers are currently being exacerbated by the war headlines, the Fed’s much anticipated first interest rate increase in years and high inflation.

> March Triple-Witching Weeks have been quite bullish in recent years. But the week after is the exact opposite, DJIA down 22 of the last 34 years—and frequently down sharply. In 2018, DJIA lost 1413 points (–5.67%) Notable gains during the week after for DJIA of 4.88% in 2000, 3.06% in 2007, 6.84% in 2009, 3.05% in 2011 and 12.84% in 2020 are the rare exceptions to this historically poor performing timeframe.

> Fear is high and sentiment is low – both near extreme contrary buy levels. Our friends at Investors Intelligence noted in their US Weekly Review that “Both Advisors Sentiment Readings and Selling Climaxes (25th February) indicate that significant market weakness is over for the time being and selected purchases can be considered.” March market trend reversals from extremes are not unusual as we experienced in 2000, 2003, 2009 and 2020. Any inklings of de-escalation would likely rally stocks.

> # Bears Come Out of Hibernation in Spite of Rebound

> In spite of the S&P 500 gaining back some ground in the past week, sentiment has continued to shift in an increasingly pessimistic direction. For a second week in a row, less than a quarter of respondents to the AAII sentiment survey reported a bullish. At 22.5%, however, current levels are still slightly above the low of 19.2% from one month ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-AAII-1.png))**

> Bearish sentiment meanwhile climbed another 4 percentage points with just under half of respondents reporting as such. Albeit elevated, bearish sentiment is not as high as the 50%+ readings reached in January and February. As for another reading on bearish sentiment from the Investors Intelligence survey, bearish sentiment is at the highest level since the March 2020 COVID low.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-AAII-2.png))**

> The bull-bear spread is extremely low at -27.3 but that is not quite as low as those past couple of weeks when over half of respondents reported as being bearish.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-AAII-3.png))**

> Not all of the increase to bears came from bulls. As shown below, neutral sentiment fell from 30.2% down to 27.8%. That is only the lowest level since the end of February. While bullish and bearish sentiment are both over a full standard deviation away from their historical averages, neutral sentiment is much more inline with its own historical average. Whereas all weeks since the start of the survey has seen neutral sentiment average a reading of 31.4%, this week's reading was only a few percentage points away.

> # Craziness In Emerging Markets

> Volatility in Chinese markets has caused the broader emerging markets ETF, EEM, to move aggressively to both the upside and downside over the last few trading days. Yesterday, EEM gained 8.05%, but the move came after the ETF moved 6.1% lower between last Thursday and Tuesday's close. All-in-all, the ETF round-tripped to the levels seen on Wednesday of last week, but EEM is still down 8.5% year to date. Since EEM began trading in 2003, the ETF has gained a little over 300%, which constitutes annualized performance of 7.7%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/EEM-since-2003-031622.png))**

> The move yesterday was high relative to historical daily moves, ranking as the 13th largest single-day upside move in its history. Larger moves were seen during the Financial Crisis and the COVID Crash. Obviously, these are not great periods to be compared to, but the occurrences were near the bottom of the pullbacks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/EEM-daily-moves-vol-031622.png))**

> EEM's daily spread versus the S&P 500 yesterday reached its highest positive level since the Financial Crisis. The last time the daily spread was above that of yesterday was on 11/21/08, in which the daily spread was +9.0%. The last time the spread even came close to this figure was during the COVID crash. Yesterday's reading was 6.1%.

> # Poor Outlook From Homebuilders

> After a small and brief pullback at the start of the month, the national average for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has continued to press higher hitting 4.46% as of the most recent reading from Bankrate.com. That is now the highest level of a 30 year fixed mortgage since the start of 2019. While the costs to finance a home have risen drastically, homebuilder sentiment has continued its decline. The NAHB's headline number on the subject fell another 2 points to 79 in March marking the third monthly decline in a row. While the decline in present sales was modest and traffic was actually up 2 points, futures sales were the major drag, falling 10 points to the lowest level since June 2020. That ties November 2018 for the third-largest month-over-month decline on record. The only two months with larger drops in this index were December 1987 (12 points) and April 2020 (39 points).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031622-NAHB-1.png))**

> Regionally, it was a similar picture in which one index saw far weaker results than the others. Homebuilders in the Northeast have seen sentiment collapse all the way down to 60 which is again the weakest reading since June 2020. While sentiment in the South has also fallen, it is nowhere close to as significant of a low. Meanwhile, the Midwest and West actually saw unchanged to improved sentiment.

> # Continuing Claims At the Lowest Level Since 1970

> Seasonally adjusted jobless claims continue to ping back and forth within their recent range between 200K and 300K. Still off the sub-200K readings from the end of last year, jobless claims fell from 229K to 214K this week. That is the lowest level since the last week of 2021 when they were 7K lower. Even though there has been no new notable low, the current level is still healthy and consistent with pre-pandemic levels that had not been observed at any other period after the early 1970s.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-Claims-1.png))**

> Jobless claims continue to have seasonal tailwinds at this point of the year and typically do not seasonally bottom until several weeks later. The current week of the year has historically been one of the strongest in terms of consistency of declines in the non-seasonally adjusted number. Since 1967, 92.7% of the time claims have fallen week over week during the current week of the year, and this year was no exception. At 202.9K, it was only slightly above the low of 196K from two weeks ago. That level is also still slightly above the readings for the same week of the year prior to the pandemic (2018 and 2019).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-Claims-2a.png))**

> Delayed an additional week making the most recent reading through the first week of March, seasonally adjusted continuing claims fell to a fresh low of 1.419 million. That is the strongest reading on continuing claims since February 1970.

> # Housing Starts and Building Permits Raise the Roof

> The latest data on residential housing for the month of February generally came in better than expected today and showed some positive longer-term trends. Starting with the actual numbers, Housing Starts increased 6.8% m/m, and while growth in multi-family units was higher than the headline number, single-family units still showed healthy growth of 5.7%. Building Permits actually showed a modest decline in February, falling 1.9%, but single-family units barely even declined. On a regional basis, despite weaker sentiment from homebuilders in the Northeast in yesterday's report from the NAHB, both Housing Starts and Building Permits in the Northeast grew more than 20% m/m which was easily the strongest showing of any region.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-Table1.png))**

> From a longer-term perspective, the 12-month average of Housing Starts made another post-financial crisis high in February rising to its highest level since March 2007. Typically, this reading starts to roll over well in advance of a recession, so the fact that it's hitting multi-year highs now should provide some relief to those who are concerned about the flattening of the yield curve.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-HS-12.png))**

> It isn't just Housing Starts that are making new highs on a 12-month average basis. The 12-month average of Building Permits also ticked up to the highest level since February 2007.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-HS-12-broken-out.png))**

> Finally, the chart below shows the 12-month average of single-family Building Permits and Housing Starts. For much of the last year, the average of single-family units was starting to show signs of rolling over as supply chain issues slowed down activity in the sector. Given housing's leading nature relative to the business cycle, this was somewhat concerning, even if the issue was more supply rather than demand-driven. February's report, though, was encouraging in that both Permits and Starts showed increases again in their 12-month averages.

1529,"As inflation bites and America’s mood darkens, higher-income consumers are cutting back on spending too",,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/as-inflation-bites-higher-income-consumers-are-cutting-back-too.html

With as much as 60% of U.S. consumers living paycheck to paycheck, it’s not a surprise to see that the spending cutbacks have started. Even with a strong job market and wage gains, as well as Covid stimulus savings, pricing spikes in core spending categories including food, gas and shelter are leading more Americans to mind their pocketbooks closely. A new survey from CNBC and Momentive finds rising concerns about inflation and the risk of recession, and Americans saying not only have they’ve started buying less but will be buying less across more categories if inflation persists. But these financial stress points are not limited to lower income consumers. The survey finds American with incomes of at least $100,000 saying they’ve cut back on spending, or may soon do so, in numbers that are not far off the decisions being made by lower income groups. The high-income consumer demographic is key to the economy. While it represents only one-third of consumers, it is responsible for up to three-quarters of the spending. As Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s notes, “If the high income consumers are out buying, we won’t see a big impact on raw consumer activity.”


Lower-income households are the most at risk, and they are the ones most likely to be making unwelcome tradeoffs to make their money stretch as far as it did just a few months ago, according to the survey results. They are also clearly experiencing more financially anxiety, according to the survey, with 57% of Americans with income under $50,000 saying they are under more stress than a year ago, versus 45% of those with incomes of $100,000 or more. The 68% of high-income consumers who said they are worried higher prices will force them to rethink financial decisions is significantly lower than the 82% of Americans with income of $50,000 or less who told the survey this, but it is still a majority. More than half of people with household incomes under $50,000 say they have already cut back on multiple expenses due to prices, and for those with income of at least $100,000, the cutback levels are already similar when it comes to dining out, taking vacations, and buying a car. “People making six-figure incomes are almost as worried about inflation as people making half as much—and they are just as likely to be taking steps to mitigate its effect on their lives,” said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research science at Momentive. “Inflation is a problem that compounds over time, and even high-income individuals won’t be insulated from the second- and third-order effects of price increases,” she said.


Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators and surveys at The Conference Board, said there is still a gap in its confidence data between lower income and higher income consumers and a lot of that is driven by the inflationary environment, and less impact the affluent will feel from factors including gas prices. She said the gap does always narrow in a pre-recession period — but its data is not indicating a recession as of now. What its confidence survey is forecasting is a slowdown in growth over the next few quarters driven by higher prices, and more Americans spending less on discretionary items as more of their money goes to covering the basics. That will be most acutely felt by the lower-income consumers, but there is broad-based concern about prices rising significantly in the months ahead — 6 out of every 10 consumers surveyed by The Conference Board think the Russia-Ukraine war will cause prices to rise significantly. “That is very broad-based and that, coupled with interest rates going up, may make people more hesitant to postpone big-ticket purchases likes housing and autos and washing machines,” Franco said. “We will see a bit of slowing in consumer spending over the next few quarters, but we don’t feel that will drive us into recession.”",tz4vs6,26,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tz4vs6/as_inflation_bites_and_americas_mood_darkens/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

1539,"Despite the political conflicts, stock prices go up. Should it make any sense?",Discussion,"Hello everybody!

&#x200B;

At the moment, we all witness the political conflict in Eastern Europe and how the world reacts to it. But, I created this sub not to discuss politics. Actually, I wonder how it will affect the stock market in the future?

&#x200B;

Basically, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine started, the whole world implemented economic sanctions against Russia. It's a fact. Another important moment that some giant international corporations, such as Apple, Microsoft, and this list I can continue for too long, decided to close their stores and online stores and fire all employees. Even companies, such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola, known globally, have decided to leave the Russian market. Many of them say it's not permanent. But, who knows?

&#x200B;

On the one hand, it's some way of punishing Russians by leaving them without some favorite goods. They are left without luxury goods and some basic necessities provided by the companies such as Procter and Gamble. Well, I hope they received the message that they have to do something.

&#x200B;

But, on the other hand, those companies are also losing their customers. Indeed, Russia is huge. It's not something like those companies looking at North Korea, but who cares? Shouldn't those actions affect the stock market too? As I understand it, those companies lose a significant profit share. So, their stock prices should go down.

&#x200B;

I expected to catch this moment with low stock prices and start investing in stocks. But, I was really shocked when I saw that stock prices, for some reason, are going up. Not all of them, but Apple's shares definitely went up. I was trying to find some logic in this, but I just can't catch on to how it's even possible. I've tried to find some explanation on sources, such as [https://investorjunkie.com/](https://investorjunkie.com/), where everything is explained in pretty much simpler terms. Still, I don't get it.

Pros: 
- It’s cheap at around ~8 forward P/E and ~19% cashflow to market cap. 
- It has a buyback program with enough in it to buy ~20% of the current shares outstanding. 
- It’s dividend just got big bump from $1.45/qrt to $1.75/qrt, is above its 5 year average at over 4% yield, and very well covered based on earnings. 

Cons: 
- The revenue growth has been very slow over the years. Earnings have grown mainly via efficiencies & share buybacks. 
- They have several competitors, and no one I’ve seen swears by the product. Seems like appliance purchasers don’t have much brand loyalty so consumer sensitivity to price is probably high. 
- While I like the manufacturing capabilities their supply chain has been hurt by the pandemic like many others.

1548,V2G(Vehicle-to-Grid) Tech Bridging The Gap Between EV and Diesel Cost In an Untapped Market,,"Full disclosure: I retained a small position in $PTRA in my Roth IRA. Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD as always.

I want to start a discussion on **V2G** as I think it has reached the turning point in commercialization of V2G tech and its unique but perfect marriage with electric school bus.

&#x200B;

**What is V2G:**

V2G or Vehicle-to-Grid is using electric vehicle specially equipped with bidirectional charging to take energy from the grid when the cost is low such as overnight and selling the energy back to the grid during peak hours when the electric cost is highest. It is important that the EV has a lot of energy left, ie: short routes and mostly unused hours/days. School buses have short routes, spend most of the day not in use and have many months without service particularly in the Summer assuming 180 days in a typical school year. Most electric vehicles can't do V2G. For example, not only my Tesla can't do bidirectional charging due to limitation, even if it could there just isn't enough 'juice' left to sell back to the grid at the end of the day because of high mileage.

&#x200B;

**Successful use of V2G in commercial settings:**

Thomas Built Buses just announced a [long term agreement](https://electrek.co/2022/03/18/electric-school-buses-are-reaching-cost-parity-with-diesel-and-a-california-district-will-deploy-one-of-the-largest-e-bus-fleets-in-the-state/) to 2025 with Highland Electric to sell a fleet of the electric bus Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley powered by Proterra's 226kWh battery and drivetrain. The 226kWh battery is the largest in the industry for school buses and has the capacity that is more than 16 times that of a Tesla Powerwall battery. This agreement is expanding on their previous fleet order of 326 electric bus in February of 2021 after Highland spent the past year successfully confirming that it is profitable using V2G on the Jouley electric school bus. [Highland estimated that a single bus generated roughly $10,000 for the company over the course of the summer](https://environmentnorthcarolinacenter.org/sites/environment/files/reports/NC_V2G%202022%20scrn.pdf#NC_V2G%202022.indd%3A11654) performing V2G. Highland will finance the purchase of the electric bus fleet, charge the Jouley bus overnight when cost is cheapest, [have the school districts pay on subscriptions for just the miles driven](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/03/21/sbaas-model-brings-electric-school-buses-to-more-districts/), then sell the leftover energy back to the grid during peak hours when the cost is highest. Highland would take care of all maintenance and charging infrastructure. Highland Electric is a company that was created for the sole purpose of commercializing V2G in electric school buses. It's doing this for profit. The result came back so promising that it resulted in them opening their order book for more.

&#x200B;

**Why is this important:**

Having a working business model where it is profitable to buy an electric school bus vs diesel is a game changer. An electric school bus is no longer viewed as just a novelty transport but as a stack of 16 Tesla Powerwalls that just happen to also earn transport income. Cost has always been the biggest hurdle in transitioning from 480,000 diesel school buses to electric. Electric school bus is often priced $120,000-$200,000 higher than its comparable diesel school bus. I'm fully aware of the few billions in funding for new electric school buses in a use-it-or-lose-it mandate and the touted $10,000 or so per year savings on fuel and maintenance. But unless the upfront cost comes down to the same level as diesel, I don't see many of those diesel getting phased out to electric. Having companies like Highland Electric take on the upfront cost and the associated long term risk would get transition to electric sped up and on a massive scale. The fact that Highland found long term, V2G not only make up the difference in $120,000-$200,000 cost difference but actually turning a profit from it is extremely intriguing. Now, for the same amount of money, school districts can get 3 electric school buses instead of 1 by having Highland maximizing the full potential of these powerful batteries instead of having them waste away in the parking lot in down time.

&#x200B;

**More companies want in on V2G:**

Aside from Thomas Built Buses long-term partnership using Proterra's 226kWH battery and drivetrain with Highland Electric, a number of other companies are taking advantage of the working V2G & electric school bus model.

\- Dominion Energy selected Thomas Built's Jouley electric bus with its 226 kWh Proterra battery for V2G ([source](https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10133648/bus-electrification-partnership-to-drive-cost-savings-cleaner-air)). Dominion plans to add 200 buses per years for the next 5 years.

\- On a smaller scale, Alaskan Energy and DTE Energy both selected the Jouley electric bus to study and obtain their own data on V2G.

\- Blue Bird will provide Nuvve with electric school bus equipped with 155 kWh battery ([source](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/09/20/nuvve-and-blue-bird-combine-to-create-electric-school-buses-that-are-v2g-enabled/))

\- BYD just released a small electric school bus with 150 kWh battery with V2G tech but no partners yet([source](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a38952770/byd-electric-school-bus-v2g-charging/)). BYD might have a difficult time getting partners as BYD is being blacklisted by US government from using tax money.

Most updated list of Utility V2G pilot programs (3/14/22): [link](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/3-design-considerations-electric-school-bus-vehicle-grid-programs)

&#x200B;

**Minimal battery degradation from V2G over 10 years:**

""In the case of frequency regulation and peak load shaving V2G grid services offered 2 hours each day, battery wear remains minimal even if this grid service is offered every day over the vehicle lifetime.""

""Frequency regulation and peak load shaving at power rates typical for vehicle charging and discharging will not significantly accelerate battery degradation in comparison to the degradation incurred from driving and calendar aging. Even in the ”extreme” cases in which we assume all EVs provide grid services from 7:00pm-9:00pm every day for ten years, the capacity losses from frequency regulation and peak load shaving only increase by 3.62% and 5.6%, respectively.""

&#x200B;

**FYI for potential investors:**

\- Proterra (PTRA) produces battery and drivetrain for Thomas Built Buses as well as other heavy-duty commercial companies. Proterra will have its 3rd and massive 327,000 square foot EV battery factory up and running in the 2nd half of 2022. Proterra also builds electric transit buses.

\- Thomas Built Buses is the oldest American bus manufacturer and is owned by Daimler. Daimler Truck is an investor in Proterra.

\- Lion Electric (LEV) is a Canadian company and it builds electric school buses among other large commercial vehicles.  Lion Electric will have its new $70 million US manufacturing plant completed late 2022.

\- Nuvve (NVVE) specializes in V2G platform and is more of an EV charging company.

The size of the pie(480,000) is so large that no single company can eat it all. Even if everyone gets just 1% of that pie or 4,800 school buses, at [$500/kWh](https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/sustainability/sustainability-12-03977/article_deploy/sustainability-12-03977.pdf) average price for battery and a 226 kWH battery, a company like Proterra would be looking at revenue of $542M for the battery alone. Proterra already [locked up](https://www.proterra.com/press-release/proterra-lg-partner-on-ev-battery-cells/) a stable supply of high-grade Nickel battery cells with LG Energy Solution through 2028.

&#x200B;

To conclude, I believe the fact that our electricity infrastructure being far from perfect is what makes V2G profitable. I'm excited at the potential of V2G opening the door to a massive and untapped market of electrification of 480,000 school buses.",tl6ekk,24,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tl6ekk/v2gvehicletogrid_tech_bridging_the_gap_between_ev/

I've heard about the term "" Compounding Interest "" and how it's the key to double/triple your investments over 30 years, but I'm not sure that I fully grasp the concept, and it's frustrating to me.

I live in Canada, so according I would buy 10,000$ worth of VFV right now, that would give me 100 shares, now how would I go about getting compounding interest with that through my TFSA?

1556,Estimating earnings on dividend reinvestment,,"I have this idea kicking around in my head that one investment goals to pay for things in 20-30 years is to:

* Purchase sufficient amount of stocks so that the quarterly dividends are enough to purchase at least an additional share each quarter
* Primarily look into [S&P Dividend Aristocrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Dividend_Aristocrats) and Dividend ETFs that grow at least at the rate of inflation
* Only consider companies that are likely to exist in 20-30 years (I.E. McDonalds, Lowes, but maybe not smaller petroleum companies)
* Only consider companies that existed before 2008 and fared well in the last recession (as an indicator that they will survive future recessions)
* Monitor these stocks, and dump/re-invest elsewhere if they look like they are going to perish
* Not kick off this model until after the next recession

&#x200B;

The initial math on what (arbitrary example) $48k of McDonalds stock is worth in 20-30 years in this strategy is fun, but I am sure I am making some mistakes.

Here's some assumptions I am making in the model (read left to right, not PEMDAS):

&#x200B;

* Enough stock was purchased to purchase a full share on the first dividend
* Partial shares can be purchased
* The stock price will grow at a rate of (current price) - (initial price) / (quarters in existence) \* (90%: 10% discount to be more conservative)
* The dividend yield will be (last 10 average yields) \* (90%: 10% discount to be more conservative)
* Taxes on earnings are not included

# [Stock futures fall for a second day as rates jump with the Fed set to tighten policy aggressively](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/05/stock-futures-inch-higher-ahead-of-fed-minutes-release.html)

*****
> Stock futures dipped for a second day on Wednesday and rates soared to new heights as investors bet the Federal Reserve is about to aggressively tighten policy to fight inflation, and in turn slow the economy.
*****
> Minutes from the Fed’s most-recent meeting are slated for release Wednesday afternoon. The minutes come from last month’s meeting when the central bank raised rates and indicated six more hikes were coming this year. Investors are bracing for new details about the Fed’s plan to reduce its balance sheet after comments from Fed officials knocked down stocks on Tuesday.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 220 points, or 0.65% on Wednesday. S&P 500 futures were down 0.9%, and Nasdaq-100 index futures shed 1.5%. All three major averages were headed for their second day of declines.
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 2.65% on Wednesday, hitting a three-year high and continuing its rapid climb this week. The rate ended Monday at 2.40%.
*****
> Fed Governor Lael Brainard in a speech on Tuesday indicated support for higher interest rates and said a “rapid” reduction of the central bank’s balance sheet could begin as soon as May. Following her remarks, the Dow pulled back by about 280 points and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.3%.
*****
> “It is of paramount importance to get inflation down,” Brainard said during a Minneapolis Fed webinar. Brainard has been nominated to be vice chair of the Federal Open Market Committee.
*****
> San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also shared concerns about inflation. “I understand that inflation is as harmful as not having a job,” Daly said.
*****
> Tech shares led Tuesday’s losses and were set to fall again on Wednesday as investors rotated out of the group and braced for higher rates to slow the economy. Chipmakers suffered some of the biggest declines, with Nvidia and Marvell Technology falling more than 5% and 6%, respectively. Both companies were set to continue their descent on Wednesday.
*****
> Tesla, Microsoft, and Amazon shares were also slated to fall more than 2% on Wednesday and Twitter shed 3% premarket after rallying this week amid news that Elon Musk purchased a large stake in the company. As the Federal Reserve hikes rates investors have begun rotating into stocks with stable profits, shying away from those offering future growth.
*****
> Investors continued to monitor the latest developments out of Europe, as the Ukraine-Russia war continues. The European Union and the U.S. are preparing to slap new sanctions on Russia after evidence emerged of war crimes allegedly committed by Russian forces. The new sanctions include a ban on Russian coal imports. (Click here for the latest.)
*****
> Crude prices, which have been volatile since the war began, rose again on Wednesday after dipping Tuesday. U.S. oil prices were up by 1.1% at $103.09 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent gained about 1%% to trade at $107.66 per barrel.

1559,Saving for buying opportunities as opposed to regular dollar cost averaging,Advice Request,"So I know about dollar cost averaging and it’s kind of unavoidable. But instead of doing that, why don’t you just get maybe 25 stocks and some ETFs. Then instead of just putting in no matter the price, you only put in at good buy prices. 
My logic is that with that many stocks there is always going to be some around good buy prices. So you invest in those ones. I guess you can dollar cost average the ETFs and some specific stocks like google and Amazon etc. But the rest, can’t I just invest like that? 

You obviously need to figure out good prices however. Some stocks may not enter those price ranges for a long time. I might sit on cash too long or over expose myself to a stock I thought was cheap but actually wasn’t. 

Anyway, hopefully someone understands what I mean. Anyone do this or is there a name for it?",tqlhg2,26,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tqlhg2/saving_for_buying_opportunities_as_opposed_to/
1560,Consumer Sentiment At Historic Low,Resources,"Consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan survey dropped to 59.4 in March 2022, down 5.4% month-to-month and 30% year-to-year.

[http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/)

Consumer sentiment has dipped below 60 three times before: 1980, 2008-2009, and 2011. These historical events were a recession from the Volcker rate hikes, another recession after the Great Financial Crisis, and fears shortly afterwards when the credit rating of the US federal government was downgraded by Moody's.

From the University of Michigan: ""When asked to explain changes in their finances in their own words, more consumers mentioned reduced living standards due to rising inflation than any other time except during the two worst recessions in the past fifty years: from March 1979 to April 1981, and from May to October 2008. Moreover, 32% of all consumers expected their overall financial position to worsen in the year ahead, the highest recorded level since the surveys started in the mid-1940s. The combination of rising prices and less positive income expectations meant that half of all households anticipated declines in inflation-adjusted incomes in the year ahead.""",tp96zi,23,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tp96zi/consumer_sentiment_at_historic_low/

1563,[Taxes] What to do with huge gains in 2021 but equally as bad losses in 2022,Advice Request,"So I was wondering if anyone is in a similar situation and has any advice on what to do. 

I had a lot of short term gains last year from day trading semiconductor companies during a few key earnings periods. I never pulled any of the money out and just reinvested profits from day trades to long term shares to hold in those same companies. Stopped day trading at the beginning of the year and since then these companies have been freefalling worse than crypto crashes. 

Now I am fucked because at this point my account is worth a little bit less than what I started with, but I also owe that same amount in taxes. Since the massive losses I would take would be this year it cannot offset any of the gains from the previous year, and I'll be limited to $3000 of losses a year which will basically take me over 25 years till I can claim all those losses. 

For now I have applied for the IRS and state payment plans but I am pissed because I basically owe them a shit ton of money for money I did not make. And you could say I made that money but lost it, but it sucks that they tax us on the way up but the relief for losses (being capped at $3000) is so little in comparison.",u28l8c,28,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u28l8c/taxes_what_to_do_with_huge_gains_in_2021_but/
1564,12K to invest. Keep in savings? I'm too damn indecisive. Help!,Advice Request,"First some background info:

\- 17.5K emergency fund (about 6 months of expenses)

\- I rent. Housing market is fcked so buying isn't really an option.

Keep it in savings?

Buy 10K worth of series i savings bonds?

Buy an ETF?

YOLO it on GME?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 28th, 2022.

# **Stocks could take their cue from oil, inflation and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/stocks-could-take-their-cue-from-oil-inflation-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> With the Federal Reserve’s first rate hike out of the way, market pros are now debating whether the market can continue the upswing it started in the past week.
*****
> March’s employment report is coming up in the week ahead, but developments in Ukraine, the price of oil and an inflation report are likely to steer the market.
*****
> Stocks notched gains for the week, while interest rates ripped higher and oil prices jumped. Energy was the top performing sector, up more than 7%, as West Texas Intermediate crude futures closed nearly 9% higher for the week. The closely-watched 10-year Treasury yield was on a tear, reaching 2.5% Friday, its highest level since May 2019 from 2.14% just a week earlier.
*****
> Traders are also watching the rise interest rates to see if they will stall the market’s gains. The S&P 500 was up nearly 1.8% for the week, ending Friday at 4,543.06.
*****
> “Since the war started, on the ten days that were up, the S&P 500 was up at least 1%,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “I don’t think next week is going to be any different. We’re going to be headline driven, whether it’s economic data, news out of Ukraine or crude oil futures.”
*****
> The market has chopped around but is higher for the month of March so far. The S&P was up nearly 3.9% for the month-to-date on Friday.
*****
> Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, said stock charts look promising for the near term but are less clear longer term.
*****
> “We should take advantage of this short-term momentum. I feel pretty good about it short-term. I mean several weeks,” she said. “We’ve also seen some nice short-term breakouts... names getting above their 50-day moving averages.”
*****
> She said 58% of the S&P 500 companies are now above their 50-day moving averages, a positive sign for momentum. The 50-day is simply the average closing price over the past 50 sessions, and a move above it can signal more upside.
*****
> Stocks like Tesla, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet have all regained their 50-day moving averages, she said. Stockton noted that some high-growth tech names have also done so. She pointed to CLOU, the Global X Cloud Computing ETF.
*****
> As for yields, she said the 10-year looks set to consolidate now that it has touched 2.50%. Her next target is 2.55%. “If we get above 2.55%, the next hurdle is 3.25%,” she said.
*****
> # Jobs and inflation
> There is a busy economic calendar in the week ahead, highlighted by the March jobs report and personal consumption expenditures data.
*****
> Consumer confidence and home price data will be released Tuesday.
*****
> PCE includes an inflation measure that is closely watched by the Fed. Economists expect to see core PCE inflation up by 5.5% year-over-year when it is reported Thursday, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> There is also the ISM manufacturing survey reported Friday. The key nonfarm payrolls report will also run that day.
*****
> Economists expect 460,000 jobs were added in March and the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to the 678,000 nonfarm payrolls added in February and an unemployment rate of 3.8%.
*****
> “I definitely think at this point that inflation data is much more meaningful than employment, in terms of the path of the economy,” said Ben Jeffery, vice president of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. Jobs will still matter, but the Federal Reserve has pivoted to focus more on combating inflation, while the economy is reaching maximum employment.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made that point when he spoke to economists Monday, saying the central bank would be willing to be more aggressive raising interest rates to battle inflation. Stocks initially sold off on his comments, amid fears the Fed could slow the economy or even bring on a recession.
*****
> Since then, stocks moved higher, but interest rates have been galloping higher. The fed funds futures market has been pricing in 50-basis-point rate hikes — or 0.5% — in both May and June.
*****
> ″[Nonfarm payrolls] will matter... I do think it’s probably going to be more a story of just how far the market is willing to press the 50-basis-point rate hike narrative, which is likely to be more pressing next week,” said Jeffery. “The excitement that once surrounded jobs is definitely less so at this point in the cycle.”
*****
> In the bond market, Jeffery said investors will be watching Treasury auctions Monday and Tuesday, when the government issues $151 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes.
*****
> Rising oil prices have been driving inflation expectations higher, and the bond market is closely watching crude prices, as is the stock market. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled up 8.8% for the week, at $113.90 per barrel Friday.
*****
> # Oil heats up
> “It seems like oil north of $100 has some staying power,” BMO’s Jeffery said.
*****
> Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said the pattern between stocks and oil will continue to be important. When oil has spiked recently, stocks have weakened, he said. Meanwhile, when crude falls, stocks have been able to rally,
*****
> “It seems like this week it was a bit more pronounced again when oil prices were rising pretty aggressively,” Arone said. “It’s got this interconnectedness to a few things — sentiment about the Ukraine conflict, how’s that going, inflation and ultimately how hawkish or dovish the Fed is going to be. I think it’s emerged as one of those binary proxies for these other elements in the market.”
*****
> “It’s just a barometer for those other things — the Ukraine conflict, inflation and the Fed,” he said.
*****
> Arone said as investors anticipate some sort of resolution that will end the conflict in Ukraine, but it’s not clear when. “The headlines coming out of Ukraine will continue to cause volatility,” he said. “At the margin, investors are gaining comfort with the likely outcome.”
*****
> Arone said stock market fundamentals are better than some investors expect. When inflation rises, topline revenues can also go higher.
*****
> “Everyone knows multiples have contracted, stocks have gotten cheaper, but one thing that’s gotten lost on investors is top-line revenues have this correlation with inflation,” he said. “Corporate profits and CPI [the consumer price index] are kind of connected. You have multiples contracting but earnings estimates are rising.”
*****
> Arone said stocks are reasonably positioned and investors are getting more comfortable that there will be a favorable resolution to the war.
*****
> “If we can get past the Ukraine conflict and some of the fears about the Fed and inflation, I think the fundamentals are okay,” he said.

> # The Bull Market Turns Two

> The bear market ended two years ago today and the subsequent bull market has clearly been an amazing ride. For some context, it was the fastest bull market to double ever, at just under 18 months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Chart-1.png))**

> Here’s where it ranks against the other bull markets that have doubled. You can see it is currently up 102%, making it the best bull market on its second birthday ever. 2009 was up 95%, coming in second.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-2.png))**

> At the recent peak in early January, the S&P 500 Index was up 114%, making it the seventh bull market to double. The annualized return of 53.4% shows just how explosive this move was off the lows and does imply some type of break could be warranted.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-3.png))**

> Here’s another way to look at this bull market as it starts year three. Previous strong bull markets saw modest gains and really spent much of the third year consolidating the previous big gains.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-4.png))**

> “As this bull market reaches the third year of life, investors need to remember that year three of bull markets tend to be a little tamer, with the larger gains happening in year one and two,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, out of the 11 bull markets since World War II, we found that three of them ended during year three, while the ones that didn’t end saw an average gain of only 5.2%.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, year three of bull markets have returned only 5.2% on average for the S&P 500, versus first year gains of 41.8% and second year gains of 12.8%, while three bull markets outright ended in year three.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-5.png))**

> We expect the bull market to continue, but some bumps in the road are normal. As the bull ages, year three could provide some of those bumps.

> For more on the bull market turning two and what could happen next, please watch the latest LPL Market Signals podcast with Jeff Buchbinder and Ryan Detrick, as they break it all down.

> # 5 Energy Stocks Reached ATHs

> Energy stocks have roared higher since the beginning of 2022, gaining a whopping 38.8% in less than three months (as of yesterday's close). This comes on the back of sharp moves higher in crude, thus implying higher margins and increased bottom line earnings per share. During the pandemic, energy stocks were among the most hurt, as a reduction in travel and economic activity led to a crash in oil markets. Although the YTD gain is certainly substantial, investors that have held energy stocks since mid-2008 are still in the red. The energy sector ETF (XLE) is still 23.0% off of its high price since the turn of the century, which occurred in June of 2014. As you can see from the chart below, XLE has broken its long-term downtrend and is nearing a breakout above 2018 levels. To retest the high of the century, XLE would need to gain another 29.8%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/XLE-since-2000-graph-032522.png))**

> On March 11th of this year, the relative strength reading of XLE vs the S&P 500 (SPY) since 2000 turned positive for the first time since COVID was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The ratio has since turned negative, and the reading is currently -5.0 percentage points. The relative strength had moved continuously lower from its high in 2008 through early 2021, but the recent reversal higher is substantial.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/XLE-vs-SPY-RS-032522.png))**

> Although Energy has been strong as of late, only five of the 63 Energy sector stocks in the S&P 1500 have hit all time highs in 2022 (to be considered, the stock must have been trading for at least five years). The five stocks are ConocoPhillips (COP), Chevron (CVX), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Matador Resources (MTDR) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). Below are the charts of these stocks since the turn of the century. The average stock on this list is up 41.3% on the year as of yesterday's close, which is only slightly greater than the performance of XLE.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/Individual-charts-032522.png))**

> Not all of the increase to bears came from bulls. As shown below, neutral sentiment fell from 30.2% down to 27.8%. That is only the lowest level since the end of February. While bullish and bearish sentiment are both over a full standard deviation away from their historical averages, neutral sentiment is much more inline with its own historical average. Whereas all weeks since the start of the survey has seen neutral sentiment average a reading of 31.4%, this week's reading was only a few percentage points away.

***** 

> # Bulls and Bears Swing Double Digits

> There's nothing like higher prices to cure investor blues, and the last week has been a perfect example of that. AAII's weekly sentiment survey saw a double-digit increase in the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish this week with that reading rising from 22.5% up to 32.8% and matching the highest level of optimism in 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-AAII-Bulls.png))**

> Those gains to bullish sentiment borrowed entirely from bears as the percentage of respondents reporting as pessimistic fell from nearly 50% of respondents down to 35.4%. The 14.4 percentage point decline marked the largest weekly decline in bearish sentiment since July 2010 when the reading had fallen by 19.27 percentage points. More recently, however, there have been a couple of other double-digit drops in bearish sentiment including a 12.3 percentage point decline in the first week of March and an 11.9 percentage point drop in December.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-AAII-Bears.png))**

> Bears continue to outnumber bulls, but the margin has narrowed to the smallest degree since the first week of the year. The bull-bear spread has risen to -2.6 after leaping higher by 24.7 points week over week; the largest one-week increase in the number since October 2019.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Looking at it another way, this week marked the first time since October 2019 that bullish sentiment rose by at least 10 percentage points while bearish sentiment fell by at least 10 percentage points in the same week. In the table below, we show each prior instance of simultaneous double-digit swings in bullish and bearish sentiment without another occurrence in the previous six months. As for how price action has responded to such swings in sentiment, the S&P 500 has generally seen consistently positive performance in the months ahead, but only one week and one-month performance has been significantly stronger on an average or median basis than what has been the norm.

> # Best Performers Since 3/14 Pivot

> Early last week, the US equity market pivoted, gaining 1%+ for four consecutive days between last Tuesday and last Friday (3/15-3/18). Sentiment has shifted amongst the investing community for the time being. For now, it seems that the market may have largely priced in some of the most hawkish Fed tightening scenarios. Remember, we already saw huge drops of 50%, 60%, 70%, even 80%+ in many of the most interest-rate sensitive growth stocks before the Fed even lifted off of 0%. How much further were investors expecting them to go?

> Since the 3/14 pivot, certain members of the S&P 1500 have already gained over 20%, but still remain well off of 52-week highs. Of the top 35 performers since last Monday, the average stock is still 43.4% off of its 52-week highs (median: 47.1%). Although there is much recovery room left for many of these high-flyers, this is a move in the right direction. The top performing stock since the 3/14 close is GameStop (GME), which has moved 58.0% higher on the back of a 30.9% move today. This may imply that investors have increased their risk appetite, or that retail investors viewed the dip as a buying opportunity, which would likely apply to the broader market from a retail perspective. Selectquote (SLQT) and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) rank immediately below GME, gaining 53.7% and 45.9% respectively. Both of these stocks are operating at a loss on the bottom line, which tells us that the risk-on trade has performed strongly over the last week. Other noteworthy names on the list include Tesla (TSLA), Avis Budget (CAR), Etsy (ETSY), NVIDIA (NVDA) and PayPal (PYPL).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/Best-perf-since-31422-032222.png))**

> Breaking this down further, the sectors that help up strongly in the face of a downturn earlier this year have performed the worst since the 3/14 pivot. Utilities and Energy members of the S&P 1500 have only gained 0.6% and 2.6% on average, respectively, since last Monday. On the other hand, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Technology members of the S&P 1500 have gained 7.8%, 8.1% and 10.6% on average, respectively. Based on the data below, the sectors most off their highs have rallied the most aggressively since the pivot, while the sector leaders from pre-3/14 have lagged.

> # Best S&P 500 Stocks Since the COVID Crash Lows

> Two years ago to the day, the S&P 500 put in a low after a 33.9% pullback from the closing high on 2/19/20. While the S&P 500 is once again off its highs, the index sits just over 100% above that 3/23/20, low and 32.7% above the pre-pandemic high. In the table below, we show the current S&P 500 components which have rallied the most since the COVID Crash low as well as how much each stock declined during the crash.

> While it was not a member of the S&P 500 at the time of the COVID crash, being added on 12/21/20, Tesla (TSLA) is currently the S&P 500 member which has risen the most since the broader market low. After being more than cut in half, it has since risen over 1,000%. The next best performers are Devon Energy (DVN) and APA Corp (APA); a couple of Energy sector names that saw even larger declines of 72.8% and 84.86%, respectively from 2/19/20 to 3/23/20. Along since Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), both stocks have risen well over 800% over the past two years. Of the list of the 25 best performers in the S&P 500, the only one that managed to move higher during the COVID Crash was vaccine producer Moderna (MRNA) which had risen 40.43% as the rest of the market collapsed.

> By the time of the 3/23/20 low, the index's worst performers since the pre-pandemic high (2/19/20) had seen monumental declines with many of those stocks dropping over 70%. On the other end of the spectrum, only four stocks had eeked out a gain and only another seven stocks had fallen single-digit percentage points.

> As for what those stocks have done since then, below we have created equal weight indices comprised of the S&P 500 members that are still actively traded that were the 20 best and 20 worst performers from 2/19/20 to 3/23/20. Each basket as well as the S&P 500 are indexed to 100 at the COVID Crash low. As shown, what had at one point been the most beaten-down names, have crushed it over the past two years; hypothetically having turned $100 into $481 having even held up well during the recent bout of weakness for equities. For comparison, the biggest winners in the early days of the pandemic bought at the lows would have only seen $100 turn into $137.64 while the S&P 500 as a whole would have a little more than doubled.

> # Jobless Claims at Lowest Level in Over 50 Years

> Since early December, initial jobless claims have risen and remained above multi-decade lows. That is until this week. Seasonally adjusted claims fell for a second week in a row down to 187K this week. That is the lowest reading since claims came in at 182K all the way back in September 1969.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> While not to take away from the historically strong reading as NSA claims also hit a new low for the pandemic of 181.1K, before seasonal adjustment, jobless claims have not exactly fallen to as significant of a low as the adjusted number. Although that is the lowest level for the current week of the year since 1969, there have been recent periods like the fall of 2018 and 2019 in which claims were even lower. Declines in initial claims have historically been common for the current week of the year, but the next couple of weeks have typically seen claims experience a brief bump before resuming a seasonal downtrend roughly through mid-spring.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

> Continuing claims have fallen even more consistently with week-over-week improvements in 7 of the past 10 weeks. Now at 1.35 million, continuing claims are down to the lowest level since the first week of 1970.

In my eyes it seems like he really has a plan to create business value long term. Also let's remember during $FB IPO the stock crashed down to about $20 and Zuck turned it around from there. 

Short term however, there are challenges. Mainly Apple IDFA-changes and transition to Reels as well as competition from TikTok.

Congrats to all bulls who held this week.

However, NVDA jumped to 260 in 4 days, which is 23% gain. For some reason, investors keep adding or buying NVDA. In the other hand, AMD and QCOM are underperforming even though they are much cheaper.

1577,What's Going On With Natural Gas Equities?,,"Over the past couple days, WTI and Brent have corrected from their highs. Normally, energy stocks in general are pretty correlated to oil price movement and the broader market. So I have never felt the need to investigate further. 

Also, over the past couple days,  both US natural gas futures and spot have gone bananas (likely a result of US shipping LNG over to Europe in the great energy reshuffling).

However, US and Canadian natural gas equity price has not followed nat gas price, but still seem to trade in correlation with WTI. Eg., OVV, LNG, CTRA. If anything, it seems to me that natural gas equities have underperformed their oil counterparts by around 20-50% post-Omicron.

Some could argue that these stocks haven't run because of the expectation that nat gas price will normalize due to the upcoming seasons of the year when demand for natural gas will wane. But that doesn't explain why these pure natural gas plays have also gone down with WTI and other oil plays.

Why is there not yet a divergence between pure natural gas and pure oil equity price performance? Shouldn't nat gas equities be outperforming oil right now?

**Spirit Airlines, so hot, right now.** With JetBlue's $3.6 billion offer, Spirit shares climbed 22%. Could this spark a bidding war with Frontier Airlines? The bid comes less than two months after Frontier and Spirit agreed to merge.  If Spirit accepts, will this jeopardize the Northeast Alliance JetBlue has with American Airlines?

**What they're saying**: “We can all agree that Spirit has a very different brand and product than JetBlue, and so at first glance you may not think we’d make a great pair,” JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes and COO Joanna Geraghty wrote to employees after announcing the bid for Spirit. “However, when you dig deeper, you’ll realize we could be a perfect match. After all, our strong belief has always been that Customers shouldn’t have to choose between a low fare and a great experience, and JetBlue is the only airline that offers both.”

**My position**: Here's a hedge on JETS ETF to give you some skin in the air travel game. Sell 1 $22 put, Exp 6/16/23.

As Freightwaves tells it, there’s going to be a “bloodbath” amongst companies that just entered the market or over-expanded in the past 2-3 years.

1582,Should I withdraw money from a taxable brokerage and max roth IRA for 2021?,,"&#x200B;

I just started investing in january with my savings from a bank account. I was stupid and started with a taxable brokerage before I found out about roth IRAs. Most of my money is in VOO and blue chips. I have about $17k invested. I am in a low tax bracket and make $15k a year (I work part time and I'm in school). I can scrounge up $2k before april 18th from my paychecks until then, as I worked overtime during spring break. I live with my parents and have no expenses other than phone bill and car insurance.

I understand I will be taxed short term capital gains if I withdraw $4k from my taxable account and I will have to pay taxes to fund the roth, but my largest gain across my stocks is only $100 and I'm in a low tax bracket. The additional $4k compounded over decades may be worth the small taxes I will have to pay. I could really use some advice.

1583,Some high quality hidden gems based on fundamentals and value,,"A lot of FUD going around recently even though the market is still off its highs. I have been meanwhile finding some great gems that show great value, no matter what the market does. Thought I would share. My approach is all based on fundamental financial analysis, no TA BS. I am summarizing and writing this off the top of my head so some numbers may not be exact, but the thesis is fucking fantastic.

**GNL -** 10%+ dividend and at least 20-30% upside.

So Global Net leases is a REIT that was trading around $25-$30 pre-pandemic. Pandemic hits and everyone shit their pants because GNL has about 30% expsoure to office buildings, fair. But 2 years later, they have retained 100% of their leases, doubled their net lease duration, and maintained or increased their dividend. Right now trading at around $16/sh with a yield over $10. Like holy fuck how can you NOT invest in this? also, their office exposure is not like the random strip mall office, its HQ of corporations like FedEx, McLaren, Finnair (ok, maybe Putin will fuck the last one up, but their largest client is only 2% of revenue). I mean literally the company would have to lose something like 40% of its revenue base and WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A 7-8% DIVIDEND YIELD.

EDIT: *Note on Debt:* A few people pointed out the high / rising debt. Keep in mind most of this is in mortgages not unsecured or corporate loans (thought they have added some of this recently taking advantage of low interest). So, they buy a property and finance a chunk of it using mortgages, and as they grow of course the debt level will grow. But the debt service coverage ratio is only 3.8x, pretty dang conservative. 

**PSTG** \- 23% Revenue CAGR, solving the world data storage crisis.

Ok, so this one was a Cathy Wood pick and maybe that alone is a reason to avoid it, but she does have some good picks. PSTG provides high efficiency data memory and storage solutions, basically solving the problem of how the hell do you build highly secure, efficient, eco friendly data centers. They offer both cloud storage and hardware for on site.

Anyway, although their stock has been volatile, the company has been quietly crushing it on all financial metrics: revenue, profitability, SaaS growth, economies of scale, etc etc. And compared to other tech stocks at eye watering multiples, these guys are at 4.5x EV / Revenue and about 20x 2023 EBITDA. With cloud, AI, VR, iot (put in all the other buzzwords) tailwinds their growth rate is more than secure and few competitors at scale are able to provide the solution that they can.

**My own Semiconductor Picks and Axes Index: ONTO, LRCX, KLAC, COHU, UCTT**

So the semiconductor gold rush is on. Everyone sees the writing on the wall that he who can make the most semis will win. But then you look at the valuations of NVDA and the shit performance of INTC and you say ""what the fuck"". Others like Hitachi and Samsung etc are just as shit and burdened with other lines of businesses. The truth is the semi market is competitive, subject to commodity prices, and subject to component prices, etc.

Its like the CA gold rush: yes everyone wants the gold but not every prospector is going to win. But the guy selling the picks and axes and shovels to every Joe Shmo who got tired of his shitty life on the East Coast and said ""im moving to CA"" is going to make money no matter what. That is what these bunch of stocks do.

They provide testing, monitoring, assembly, and other shit that goes into a semi conductor factory. There are about 12 MAJOR factories going up over the next 2-3 years. The semi market will grow at nice 8-10% CAGR. BUT the CAPEX on Semi facilities is forecasted to grow 14% (so ya net net semi conductor produces are losing 4%). These bunch have the best growth, profitability, and valuations to capture that 14% growth.",tt5cer,22,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tt5cer/some_high_quality_hidden_gems_based_on/

1585,Is it really true that labor market is such a strong that anyone can get hired?,,"So the Fed keeps saying the labor market is strong that interest rate hike is justified. 

However, my story says very differently, and so does what r/jobs says, where you will see so many employers baiting and switching. 

Sure, compared to when I first was looking into jobs in 2016, it seems like the job market gets better, but is it really strong enough that employers are paying upend price to hire someone? 

# My experience 

My job application stats in last 3 months , pretty much all pharma tickers that many people trade would know such as PFE/TMO/LLY/JNJ/ABBV/ABT. Applied 30+ jobs

I have 5 years of experience/MS STEM degree/basic computer programming skills (Python/R+/Excel), but can't seem to find jobs.

Just finished 3rd round of interview a week ago, 1st HR screen interview, 2nd hiring manager 1:1 interview over the virtual meeting (cuz the location is at the other side of the coast) and 3rd panel interviews. 

During 3rd panel interviews, it was 3 hours interviews, including a quick presentation of my previous projects and lunch time, all of which are about to judge me as a potential employee and a colleague, indicating how much selective they are. I dont like it from the begining to the end. 

And per glassdoor, this position pays around 95K as a base pay in the location. 

Common, all I am looking for is just W2 wage for 70-80K base pay (in midwest standard) with work life balance, if that's not too much. 

&#x200B;

# Fed's evaluation and rate hike

Part of reason here is to vent about this distorted job markets, but primary reason to share is to see if this what's called ""Strong job market"" is able to support Fed's rate hike in the next course of the months, if not years, without causing recessions? 

Fed might say that due to great resignation and population change (Boomers retiring and more workforce is needed), the labor market clearly favors employees, but I am not sure if that will actually support the economy in the long run. Great resignation people who might have benefited in 2021's bull run are running almost out of their profits. 

Current index level is about May 2021, and many still are uncertain if recent 2 weeks' market run-up is only the beginning of the bear markets or will start to recover. So those great resignation folks might have to come back to workforce when Index crashed another 10-15%. 

Then when it come to population change, corporates wont simply hire a new employee just because the employee is leaving. Sure, when department manager complains and bring it to the issue to upper management, it might, but corporate America is all about squeezing employees out like slaves, and return the money back to share holders, so if they find out the department can run without the retired employees, then they wont simply hire (I am currently working in one of the tickers that I have shared, but have seen this case so often that there is no replacement for the leaving employees, and the left over is on current employees). 

So how does this mean strong labor market will continue? 

Understandably, it can really differ depending on which sectors and regions, for instance, one of my family members just got into JPM as investor consultant, and the starting point was 150K in NYC, which would be almost same as 70-80K in my area when it comes to buying powers per nerd wallet living cost calculator. 

Also yes, if I want to work in MCD flipping burgers or in WMT/COST just loading some boxes, sure I can be hired within 30 minutes, but do we really call this as strong job markets? In other words, 15$ per hour job is available everywhere, but do we really call it a job? It's just part time gig that is only used as a stepping stone to move to next chapter of life. 

Then when it comes to actual jobs that have potential career ladders, this kind of jobs are highly selective such as what I went through, and with technologies developing, the demand for workforce will be likely discontinued.  

# Big Question: Okay, so what? What's the outcome? 

Perhaps, no one knows the outcome including any Fed members, but I still believe that deflationary pressure are at full force when it comes to labor markets and inflationary pressure are at full force when it comes to raw materials due to deglobalization of the current political climate.

To me it sounds like exactly stagflation, where no one can make money, but who knows? The chance is I will be most likely wrong, and I hope I am wrong on this.",tos7ha,26,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tos7ha/is_it_really_true_that_labor_market_is_such_a/

> Ukraine will continue to be a focus, and headlines could continue to create volatility in the coming week. Investors are also watching the course of Covid, which is causing shutdowns of Chinese cities and is spreading again at a higher rate in Europe.
*****
> There are more than a dozen Fed speeches, including from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who appears at an economics conference Monday and at an international banking conference Wednesday. The economic calendar is relatively light, with durable goods and both services and manufacturing PMI released Thursday.
*****
> “The anticipation of the first rate hike did more damage than the rate hike itself. We got ourselves twisted in a knot, starting in December, with the Fed pivot from transitory inflation to tapering” [bond purchases], said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “That’s kind of behind us now as a headwind. That diminishes the impact that any parade of Fed speakers will deliver.”
*****
> The market indeed ignored hawkish comments Friday from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who appeared on CNBC. Both said they want to raise rates faster than the median seven hikes the Fed expects this year.
*****
> The Fed released its interest rate forecast Wednesday, when it raised its fed funds target rate range by a quarter point to 0.25% to 0.50%, its first rate hike since 2018. The Fed also said it would look to start reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet at an upcoming meeting.
*****
> Tech and growth did well in the past week, and they are the stock groups most hurt by higher interest rates. They typically command higher prices because investors buy them for their future earnings, and easy money makes them very attractive.
*****
> Strategists say tech can continue to gain in a rising rate environment, now that some of the excesses are wrung out of the group. But they may not be the leaders they once were.
*****
> # Looking past the Fed
> “I think the stage has been set by the Fed for investors to focus on earnings again,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities, derivatives and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI. “Bottom line...earnings estimates since the beginning of the year have risen.”
*****
> Emanuel said he expects the market could continue to rise in the near term, barring an escalation of geopolitical events. While it appears oil prices may have peaked, he said it is still not clear whether stocks put in the low for the year.
*****
> “Sentiment is absolutely horrendous...You put it all together, and we just think it’s a recipe for higher share prices looking out over the next month or two,” Emanuel said. He said investors are now able to discount the fact the Fed has begun its rate hiking cycle.
*****
> “We’re there. We know what’s going to happen. We know they’re going to do 0.25% in May. We know they’re going to start QT [quantitative tightening] some time at mid-year,” he said. “They’re not raising rates enough that it’s really going to hurt the market and investors can focus on earnings again.” He expects S&P 500 profits to be up 9.3% this year.
*****
> Hogan said the market is leaning towards a favorable outcome for Ukraine, such as a cease fire, although no developments suggest an end is now in sight.
*****
> “Everyone is leaning in this direction that this will come to an end in weeks rather than months,” he said. “If not, the market is going to have to recalibrate that.”
*****
> # This is what the stock charts say
> Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, focuses on the short-term technicals of the market, and he said after a strong run, the market could digest some of its gains early in the week.
*****
> “After an impressive week like this, most active traders are reducing risk into this [S&P 500] 4,400 level, not adding to it,” said Redler. “If we could digest a day or two after quadruple witching that might give us some signals that this could continue towards 4,600.” The quadruple expiration of options and futures was Friday.
*****
> Redler said Russia’s war in Ukraine and Fed policy tightening will continue to hang over the market, and that might keep the S&P 500 in a range. “I don’t think anyone is thinking the market goes right back to all-time highs anytime soon,” he said. “I think we’re smack in the middle of a range. This is a very neutral spot not to get short and not to add to longs. We’ll see how we digest this next week. For me, I think oil put the high in for the year, and that could be helpful.”
*****
> Oil briefly popped to $130.50 per barrel earlier this month, when investors feared sanctions on Russia would restrict its oil exports and create major shortages. Since then oil has fallen back, and West Texas Intermediate crude futures were trading just under $105 per barrel Friday.
*****
> Redler said an important test for the S&P 500 will be to see if it can hold the top third of its range and stay above 4,330. “It if can hold that, the next move could be higher,” he said. “That would show commitment to this week’s actions.”
*****
> Technology shares made a strong comeback, and Redler said he is watching to see if they continue to lead. “Tesla helped lead the way all week. A bunch of tech names did break their downtrends,” he said. “Tesla, NVIDIA and Amazon have been buyable on dips...NVIDIA gave clues that the bounce was as believable as it because it was one of the first stocks to cross its downtrend line.”
*****
> Apple and Microsoft, both higher on the week, could be important drivers of the market in the coming week.
*****
> “Apple and Microsoft haven’t been a headwind but they weren’t a tailwind. If they could outperform a little bit, they could help the broader indices,” Redler said. He said the two stocks, the biggest by market cap, were higher on the week, but they lagged the Nasdaq’s gains because they had they had large sell imbalances during the quadruple witching expiration.
*****
> “The stocks with the biggest buybacks have the biggest selling imbalances,” Redler said.

> # Beware the Ides of March

> On the eve of the Ides of March DJIA registered an ominous 6thDown Friday/Down Monday of 2022 – emblematic of the entrenched downtrend and headline risk from the war, the Fed and inflation. The bulls are clearly on the run. But we can find some solace in the fact that support around the February 24 intraday lows held up again today. Though that support is admittedly tenuous. The next level of support is down near the March 2021 lows around DJIA 31000, S&P 3875, NASDAQ 12500, NDX 13000. Russell 2000 seems to be finding support above 1900.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cb566a95677ef6730e6af62e91354560/4ae9229666a9009e-a0/s500x750/fc1f8b993b019d3d9b041176b6f8896af7223bae.jpg))**

> Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to “beware the Ides of March” but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. March is a volatile time for the market. It is the end of the first quarter, which brings with it Triple Witching and an abundance of portfolio maneuvers from The Street. And those maneuvers are currently being exacerbated by the war headlines, the Fed’s much anticipated first interest rate increase in years and high inflation.

> March Triple-Witching Weeks have been quite bullish in recent years. But the week after is the exact opposite, DJIA down 22 of the last 34 years—and frequently down sharply. In 2018, DJIA lost 1413 points (–5.67%) Notable gains during the week after for DJIA of 4.88% in 2000, 3.06% in 2007, 6.84% in 2009, 3.05% in 2011 and 12.84% in 2020 are the rare exceptions to this historically poor performing timeframe.

> Fear is high and sentiment is low – both near extreme contrary buy levels. Our friends at Investors Intelligence noted in their US Weekly Review that “Both Advisors Sentiment Readings and Selling Climaxes (25th February) indicate that significant market weakness is over for the time being and selected purchases can be considered.” March market trend reversals from extremes are not unusual as we experienced in 2000, 2003, 2009 and 2020. Any inklings of de-escalation would likely rally stocks.

> # Bears Come Out of Hibernation in Spite of Rebound

> In spite of the S&P 500 gaining back some ground in the past week, sentiment has continued to shift in an increasingly pessimistic direction. For a second week in a row, less than a quarter of respondents to the AAII sentiment survey reported a bullish. At 22.5%, however, current levels are still slightly above the low of 19.2% from one month ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-AAII-1.png))**

> Bearish sentiment meanwhile climbed another 4 percentage points with just under half of respondents reporting as such. Albeit elevated, bearish sentiment is not as high as the 50%+ readings reached in January and February. As for another reading on bearish sentiment from the Investors Intelligence survey, bearish sentiment is at the highest level since the March 2020 COVID low.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-AAII-2.png))**

> The bull-bear spread is extremely low at -27.3 but that is not quite as low as those past couple of weeks when over half of respondents reported as being bearish.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-AAII-3.png))**

> Not all of the increase to bears came from bulls. As shown below, neutral sentiment fell from 30.2% down to 27.8%. That is only the lowest level since the end of February. While bullish and bearish sentiment are both over a full standard deviation away from their historical averages, neutral sentiment is much more inline with its own historical average. Whereas all weeks since the start of the survey has seen neutral sentiment average a reading of 31.4%, this week's reading was only a few percentage points away.

> # Craziness In Emerging Markets

> Volatility in Chinese markets has caused the broader emerging markets ETF, EEM, to move aggressively to both the upside and downside over the last few trading days. Yesterday, EEM gained 8.05%, but the move came after the ETF moved 6.1% lower between last Thursday and Tuesday's close. All-in-all, the ETF round-tripped to the levels seen on Wednesday of last week, but EEM is still down 8.5% year to date. Since EEM began trading in 2003, the ETF has gained a little over 300%, which constitutes annualized performance of 7.7%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/EEM-since-2003-031622.png))**

> The move yesterday was high relative to historical daily moves, ranking as the 13th largest single-day upside move in its history. Larger moves were seen during the Financial Crisis and the COVID Crash. Obviously, these are not great periods to be compared to, but the occurrences were near the bottom of the pullbacks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/EEM-daily-moves-vol-031622.png))**

> EEM's daily spread versus the S&P 500 yesterday reached its highest positive level since the Financial Crisis. The last time the daily spread was above that of yesterday was on 11/21/08, in which the daily spread was +9.0%. The last time the spread even came close to this figure was during the COVID crash. Yesterday's reading was 6.1%.

> # Poor Outlook From Homebuilders

> After a small and brief pullback at the start of the month, the national average for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has continued to press higher hitting 4.46% as of the most recent reading from Bankrate.com. That is now the highest level of a 30 year fixed mortgage since the start of 2019. While the costs to finance a home have risen drastically, homebuilder sentiment has continued its decline. The NAHB's headline number on the subject fell another 2 points to 79 in March marking the third monthly decline in a row. While the decline in present sales was modest and traffic was actually up 2 points, futures sales were the major drag, falling 10 points to the lowest level since June 2020. That ties November 2018 for the third-largest month-over-month decline on record. The only two months with larger drops in this index were December 1987 (12 points) and April 2020 (39 points).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031622-NAHB-1.png))**

> Regionally, it was a similar picture in which one index saw far weaker results than the others. Homebuilders in the Northeast have seen sentiment collapse all the way down to 60 which is again the weakest reading since June 2020. While sentiment in the South has also fallen, it is nowhere close to as significant of a low. Meanwhile, the Midwest and West actually saw unchanged to improved sentiment.

> # Continuing Claims At the Lowest Level Since 1970

> Seasonally adjusted jobless claims continue to ping back and forth within their recent range between 200K and 300K. Still off the sub-200K readings from the end of last year, jobless claims fell from 229K to 214K this week. That is the lowest level since the last week of 2021 when they were 7K lower. Even though there has been no new notable low, the current level is still healthy and consistent with pre-pandemic levels that had not been observed at any other period after the early 1970s.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-Claims-1.png))**

> Jobless claims continue to have seasonal tailwinds at this point of the year and typically do not seasonally bottom until several weeks later. The current week of the year has historically been one of the strongest in terms of consistency of declines in the non-seasonally adjusted number. Since 1967, 92.7% of the time claims have fallen week over week during the current week of the year, and this year was no exception. At 202.9K, it was only slightly above the low of 196K from two weeks ago. That level is also still slightly above the readings for the same week of the year prior to the pandemic (2018 and 2019).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-Claims-2a.png))**

> Delayed an additional week making the most recent reading through the first week of March, seasonally adjusted continuing claims fell to a fresh low of 1.419 million. That is the strongest reading on continuing claims since February 1970.

> # Housing Starts and Building Permits Raise the Roof

> The latest data on residential housing for the month of February generally came in better than expected today and showed some positive longer-term trends. Starting with the actual numbers, Housing Starts increased 6.8% m/m, and while growth in multi-family units was higher than the headline number, single-family units still showed healthy growth of 5.7%. Building Permits actually showed a modest decline in February, falling 1.9%, but single-family units barely even declined. On a regional basis, despite weaker sentiment from homebuilders in the Northeast in yesterday's report from the NAHB, both Housing Starts and Building Permits in the Northeast grew more than 20% m/m which was easily the strongest showing of any region.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-Table1.png))**

> From a longer-term perspective, the 12-month average of Housing Starts made another post-financial crisis high in February rising to its highest level since March 2007. Typically, this reading starts to roll over well in advance of a recession, so the fact that it's hitting multi-year highs now should provide some relief to those who are concerned about the flattening of the yield curve.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-HS-12.png))**

> It isn't just Housing Starts that are making new highs on a 12-month average basis. The 12-month average of Building Permits also ticked up to the highest level since February 2007.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-HS-12-broken-out.png))**

> Finally, the chart below shows the 12-month average of single-family Building Permits and Housing Starts. For much of the last year, the average of single-family units was starting to show signs of rolling over as supply chain issues slowed down activity in the sector. Given housing's leading nature relative to the business cycle, this was somewhat concerning, even if the issue was more supply rather than demand-driven. February's report, though, was encouraging in that both Permits and Starts showed increases again in their 12-month averages.

1592,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 11, 2022",Recap/Watchlist,"**Psycho’s Market Recap - Monday, April 11, 2022**

Concerns over inflation, geopolitical tensions, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy path forward remain at the center of investor’s mind and led stocks to decline today. Treasury yields rose again, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hitting 2.7%, the highest level in over three years. The price of oil declined once again to roughly $95 a barrel, the level prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 

**Markets Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.71%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -2.37%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.20%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.67%
* Volatility Index (VIX): +15.17%
* Apple (AAPL): -2.55%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): -5.23%
* Alphabet (GOOGL): -3.35%
* Microsoft (MSFT): -3.88%

* Bilibili (BILI): +7.16%
* System1 (SST): +7.43%

Last week, the Fed’s meeting minutes showed officials want to start reducing their balance sheet by around $95 billion a month, a process known as quantitative tightening (QT). The opposite of quantitative easing, QT is a contractionary policy meant to decrease the amount of liquidity within the economy. 

The minutes said, “Notwithstanding uncertainties associated with geopolitical developments, many central banks continued to signal intentions to move ahead with reducing policy accommodation to address elevated inflation.”

On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the latest consumer price index (CPI), which is expected to show an eye-watering +8.4% year-over-year increase in prices, the fastest pace of inflation since 1982. This comes as Federal Reserve officials increasingly talk about implementing a larger-than-average 50 basis point hike to the interest rate to help bring down prices. The producer price index (PPI), which measures the changes over time paid to producers, will be release on Wednesday.

Seth Carpenter, Global Chief Economist for Morgan Stanley, said “If we think about recent cycles that are comparable, I think about 2018, 2019, the Fed was raising interest rates and running off its balance sheet. That should sound very familiar. But at the end of 2018, risk markets started to crack and the Fed reversed course really quickly. The key difference now between those two episodes is they are trying to pull inflation down. They're not trying to keep it from rising,"" he added. ""And so what that means is they're trying to slow the U.S. economy. They're trying to slow growth so much that inflation pressures come down but not so much that they tip us over into recession. And that's tricky.""

While inflation remains front and center, the start of the latest quarterly earnings season will show how companies have navigated elevated prices and the effects of inflation on growth. As of Friday, Wall Street analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to grow 4.5% for the first quarter over last year, according to FactSet data. If realized, this would mark the slowest rate since the fourth quarter of 2020.

David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “Guidance and management commentary will be particularly important sources of information this quarter given the earnings uncertainty going forward. Consistent with prior quarters, guidance has recently been a key differentiator of stock performance.""

**Highlights**

* NVIDIA (NVDA) stock fell after analysts at Rober W Baird slashed rating from outperform to neutral and the price target from $360 to $225, citing falling demand and rising cancellations of existing orders.
* Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans joined the chorus of Fed speakers publicly discussing prospects of a 50 basis point interest rate hikes as inflationary pressures remain elevated. ""Fifty is obviously worthy of consideration. Perhaps it's highly likely even if you want to get to neutral by December,"" Evans [said in remarks before the Detroit Economic Club on Monday.](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/2022/april-11-detroit-economic-club)
* Microsoft (MSFT) shares were lower intraday on Monday after UBS analysts suggested the tech company's Office 365 business would begin to see a sales slowdown following a work-from-home spike in business.
* U.S. [consumers are now looking for an even more marked increase in prices](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-consumers-view-inflation-spending-151118285.html) next year than previously anticipated, according to a new survey from the New York Federal Reserve released Monday. Consumers anticipate inflation will rise by 6.6% in the next year, according to a survey by the New York Fed, representing the fastest expected rate since the survey first began in 2013. In February, consumers expected year-ahead inflation would rise by 6.0%.
* Shares of Twitter (TWTR) dropped but clawed back losses after Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk opted not to join the board after buying a more than 9% stake in the company.
* Ford Motor Co said on Monday it has signed a preliminary deal to buy lithium from a Lake Resources NL facility in Argentina, marking the first time the automaker has publicly announced where it will procure the electric vehicle battery metal.

I have a question for the tech guys around here, or anyone who has a legit answer, basically.

I have been looking at data center REITs like Equinix & Digital Realty.
They seem to have an excellent track record of growth.

However, the tech world is constantly changing.

So the question is, how important are data centers are , and how sustainable are they for the future?

Do you guys think data center REITs will go out of fashion in the next 20 years? Are there any real alternatives? Or will there be a demand for them forever?

After seeing another post about a school stock competition, it reminded me of the ""feud"" on whether YouTuber boxing is good for the sport.

On one hand, introducing kids to finance and stocks is good because it (hopefully) destigmatize fears and misconceptions about the stock market. This could lead to better financial literacy and independence in the future.

On the other hand, however, it may encourage risky plays over slow and steady in order to ""win"" the competition (I.E most money after a year/semester = win). If a random kid throws the fake money into a random penny stock that 10x it must be super easy in real life to make money right?

1597,Using VIX standard deviation to swing trade,,"Ok, listened to the compound podcast- heard something about VIX having a mean of 20 and a standard deviation (sigma) of 8. Guy also mentions that 20 and 36 are inflection points. I compared VIX and SPY on a chart and found this to be generally true- 36 VIX is typically a good time to buy a dip and 20 VIX can be a good time to sell if you had previously bought at 36. If you had bought at at VIX lower than 20, then 20 is a good time to sell. Obviously there will be exceptions, and VIX has gone much higher during 2008 and 2020 crashes, up to 60 and higher. EDIT: a 2 sigma move represents a 95% statistical probability. So hypothetically this method represents a 95% chance of working, with 5% risk, not including paying the premiums on the options. 

It appears to me that because wall street may use these metrics of the VIX as a trading signal that the charts end up reflecting large trading activity by investment banks and institutions. You also wouldn't want to speculate on individual stocks using VIX- more like using VIX as a signal to trade options on SPY.

It would theoretically look like this:

1. VIX hits 36. Buy slightly OTM calls 3-6 months+ to exp.
2. VIX approaches 20. Sell calls. Buy puts with stop loss. Same with slightly OTM, 3-6 months+
3. Sell puts when VIX spikes, buy calls again. Repeat as desired.

Currently VIX is at 19.62, just below 20. We appear to be at an inflection point where either the bull market is going to recover or we are headed for another leg down as rate hike fears, supply chain problems, and inflation hurt corporate earnings.",tusnmp,22,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tusnmp/using_vix_standard_deviation_to_swing_trade/

The uranium sector is evolving towards an inevitable global uranium supply shortage. China is building many reactors on time and on budget! They aim to build an additional 150 reactors between 2021 and 2035. That’s an additional \~30% global uranium consumption/demand by 2035 compared to today due to China alone! And India, Russia, Turkey, … are also building additional reactors, while western countries are mainly extending existing reactors (USA, Canada, France, …). Even Japan is restarting reactors.

Important to know here is that unenriched uranium only represence 5% of the total electricity production cost from a nuclear reactor, meaning that if the uranium price would double in price it would not significantly impact the electricty price. --> **The demand for uranium is price** **inelastic.**

As a comparisation gas represence \~70% of the total electricity production cost from a gas-fired power plant, meaning that a gas price that doubles or triples hugely impacts the electricity production cost price! **That’s what especially Europe is experiencing right now!**

An uranium spotprice of 75 USD/lb in 2022 and a combined market cap of 80 billion USD will not surprise me in 2022. In my opinion the uranium sector will reach an even higher combined market cap in the coming years.

Note 2: 3 alternatives for URA are URNM, HURA and Geiger Counter Limited.

Note 3: Investing in physical uranium is also possible through Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, Yellow Cake and in the future in Asia also through ANU Energy.

This isn't financial advice. I'm only expressing my own opinion based on my own DD on the matter.

*For April, the EIA now sees U.S. crude in the Permian rising from 5.138 million bpd to 5.208 million bpd—a 70,000 bpd rise. The Eagle Ford is expected to see the second largest increase with a 23,000 bpd rise to 1.146 million bpd. The Bakken is expected to increase by 16,000 bpd.*

*The EIA has estimated that the number of Drilled but Uncompleted wells (DUCs) fell 156 to 4,372 for the month of February. The DUC count—or fracklog—is often seen as a bellwether for the state of the oil industry. Higher DUC counts often signal that oil companies are comfortable spending money on wells that are unfinished and no producing.

1611,Investing 40K over 3 years,,"I write this with trepidation because I certainly don't want to be spammed.  :-(

I have come upon 40K through work that I want to invest.  This 40K is mine to keep if I stay at work for 3 years..but if I leave prior to that I have to pay it back in full w/ interest.  I have no intention on leaving at all, but I cannot predict the future.  So I want to reasonably make as much off this as I can over 3 years knowing that at anytime I have to pay it back.

Seeing that inflation is 7-8% for the forseeable future....and there might be a 1/3 chance of staginflation or a recession in the next 1-2 years....some of my options are

1) keep it in a bank savings account, make 0.5 - 1% / year (not ideal).

2) buy bonds (e.g. muni) that pay 2.5-4%/year

3) Buy US treasuries, make like 1-2%/year

4) invest in stable, blue chip dividend stocks.  e.g. VZ, C...those are depressed and have yields of 5 and 4% respectively.

5) something like JEPI that writes covered calls on the S&P 500..which over the next year might be a good idea.  Covered call funds mute returns but there won't be much positive gains in the S&P 500 during that time

6) buy index fund ETFs

7) US treasure I-bonds (yield 7+% but there is a payment penalty if sold prior to 5 years)

8) Maybe buy select ""stagflation"" protected ETFs like energy, health care, consumer staples, etc.

1614,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 1, 2022",Recap/Watchlist,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 1, 2022**

The stock market closed the week mixed in a choppy session as market participants watched a potential recession indicator in the bond market and strong labor market data that reaffirmed expectations that the Fed will continue aggressively tightening monetary policy. The price of oil continued its decline, falling below $100 a barrel as the US initiated the largest release of oil reserves ever.

President Biden unveiled plans to release 1 million barrels of oil a day starting May for the next six months. This is the largest release of reserve petroleum ever in an effort to fight spiking energy prices. Oil spiked to as high as $130 earlier in the month, leading to record prices at the pumps. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil fell $14 to dip below $100 per barrel in its biggest weekly dollar loss since 2011.

President Biden said, “This is a moment of consequence and peril for the world, and pain at the pump for American families. Our prices are rising because of Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions,"" he said. There isn't enough supply. And the bottom line is if we want lower gas prices we need to have more oil supply right now.” While this is not entirely true (the price of oil had been rising even before), the price of oil dramatically spiked following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. 

Despite the recent rally, the market continues to face a number of headwinds. Investors are nervously eyeing a flattening yield curve, with longer-duration bonds yields falling below shorter-term term yields. 

The spread, or difference, between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury note yields narrowed to its lowest level since 2019 earlier this week and briefly inverted on Tuesday. [A yield curve inversion has a history of predicting a recession](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/yield-curve.asp#:~:text=The%20slope%20of%20the%20yield,about%20economic%20activity%20and%20inflation.), with each of the last eight recessions dating back to 1969 preceded by a yield curve inversion.

The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed more people joining the workforce, likely attracted by the higher wages. Employment in professional and business services, financial activities and retail sectors is now above pre-pandemic levels.

The 11th straight month of job gains in excess of 400,000 underscored the economy's resilience even as growth appears to have slowed considerably in the first quarter under the weight of high inflation amid snarled supply chains. Here are the numbers:

* Nonfarm payrolls increase 431,000 in March
* February payrolls gain revised up to 750,000 from 678,000
* Unemployment rate falls to 3.6% from 3.8%
* Average hourly earnings rise 0.4%; up 5.6% year-on-year
* Employment in some sectors now above pre-pandemic levels

Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said, “Despite concerns about inflation and the Russia-Ukraine war, American businesses are still hiring at full throttle, while more people are returning to the labor force. That's great news for the economy. However, the labor market is only getting tighter and wages are on a clear upward track, fanning the inflation flames. The Fed has every reason to go big or go home on May 4.""

Yesterday, In its monthly private payroll report, [ADP reports payrolls rose by 455,000.](https://adpemploymentreport.com/2022/March/NER/docs/ADP-NATIONAL-EMPLOYMENT-REPORT-March2022-Final-Press-Release.pdf) Consensus economists were looking for 450,000 jobs to return, according to Bloomberg data. In February, employers brought back 486,000 payrolls, based on ADP's upwardly revised monthly print.

April has historically been a strong month for stocks, and has in fact produced a positive return for the S&P 500 in 15 of the last 16 years, according to LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick. This time, however, stocks are facing a variety of headwinds that may upend this historically positive seasonality.

The markets are gacing a confluence of geopolitical and economic headwinds, which contributed to the S&P 500’s worst quarterly performance in two years. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, already disrupted supply-chains have been further snarled. Broad price inflation makes goods of all kinds, hitting consumers, the key drivers of the economy, squarely in the pocket. In response to elevated inflation, the Federal Reserve has begun its tightening cycle by raising the interest rate and reducing its balance sheet.

1617,Am I making a mistake by selling off my mutual funds?,,"The wife and I started investing in some Vanguard Life Strategy funds (VASIX & VASGX) last year with cash we had sitting around in our Ally accounts. I realize now these might not have been the best investment vessels, but it's too late to undo that. 

 • We're planning on buying a new house in about two years and decided to switch our strategy to go in cash-rich for the purchase.

 • We're trying to hit a target dollar value by that point, so I'm planning to sell shares at their 1 year investment marks.

 • Selling our >1 year VASIX shares right now will realize about a 7k loss, and the VASGX will be basically a wash. 

 • We have no other capital gains or losses yet for the year, but plan to continue to liquidate the funds at their 1 year mark and putting them into an ALLY account. 

My understanding is that I can only carry 3k of the capital losses into following years, so the extra losses are just that, losses. The market may change a bit before I sell off the other shares, cancelling out some capital gains, but who knows.

Large cap tech growth has done phenomenally obviously. But, given the current financial climate, how much positive EV is left here right now?

I feel like I might need to go for a bit of a barbell approach and introduce SCHD into the mix to diversify out of large cap growth into large cap value/dividend aristocrats. I am also toying with the idea of adding AVUV/AVDV/AVEM to get small cap value and international markets exposure.Some think they are poised to outperform in the next years.

So, something like:

40% SCHD 25% QQQM 15% AVUV 10% AVDV 10% AVEM 

I kind of like this because all have minimal to no overlap between each other. Didn't want to go with VOO as it already has significant overlap with QQQ in terms of large cap growth.And if we do go into a recession in the next few quarters growth plays will get hit the hardest. 

Plus, SCHD provides some dividend income that can be used to buy potential dips. 

I might switch the allocation between SCHD/QQQM around again in the next few years if I see that large cap growth sufficiently bottomed.",tsgjln,21,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tsgjln/schdqqqm_for_the_long_term/
1619,"In a world of scarcity, panic-buying of things in short supply, Potash is an essential fertilizer and there's not enough. NTR, MOS, IPI",,"\- Russia and Belarus account for 37.6% of 2019 potash production. It's been sanctioned by the largest economies in the world. China was another 10% of the market and they are severely limiting and banning exports on fertilizer.

\- Potash fertilizer is irreplaceable. Using more nitrogen or phosphate won't help. All of these fertilizers do their own unique things to support crop growth. Potash is actually known to be good for water absorption, drought protection and generating protein.

\- Saskatchewan, Canada is a major producer and thankfully is friendly with USA, but they have something called ""Canpotex"" (Canadian Potash Exporters) which controls all of their potash supply - you should think of Canpotex like its OPEC (oil). It's organized as a cartel. They share the same rail infrastructure, they hold back supply of potash (""spare capacity"") to keep prices higher. It's just TWO companies! Nutrien (""NTR"") and Moaic Company (""MOS""). If you've never heard of Nutrien, some of you people that have been paying attention for a few years might recognize Potash Corp of Saskatckewan and Agrium -- Nutrien is the combined company. They control the vast majority of potash mining supply in the only major potash ore bed in the world that isn't sanctioned.

\- I've followed this industry for 15 years. BHP tried to buy Potash Corp of Sask. in 2010, but Canada blocked it b/c potash was too strategically important. I have a friend whose wife worked at one of these companies and they were all celebrating in 2006 when a Russian potash mine flooded, and in 2014 when a massive pothole formed from a Russian potash mine that became ruined (google search the image...you might remember this from 2014). Those were just single mines, and now all of it is off the market. That's 37.6% of 2019 global production. For comparison, Russia is only 11% of global oil production and Belarus isn't an oil producer.

\- This is serious business. In crazy Russian drama, in August 2013, the CEO of Uralkali (Russia potash), he was detained at an airport in Minsk, Belarus and thrown in jail for 14 months for breaking up the Belarusian Potash Cartel in June 2013. Look it up, its a crazy story. Belarus normally gets along with Russia but this seriously pissed them off!! If you look up the dictator Alexander Lukashenko, this would make sense...that man is way crazier than Trump.

\- Their phones in Saskatoon are ringing off the hook right now. The world really needs more potash or else crop yields will be a lot lower without this essential crop fertilizer. Especially from countries worried about doughts from climate change b/c potash is good for water absorption to help plants grow.

\- NTR, MOS and IPI are the plays. IPI is the higher cost producer in America with more beta to potash prices. Think of IPI in USA like this: NTR/MOS are the Saudi Arabia of oil (they own the the most production, massive, low cost mines from the best reserves on the planet), and IPI is the oil frackers in USA...higher cost that feels pain downturns but is en fuego in bull markets. So if you look at these stocks and wonder why IPI is more volatile/higher beta, that is why.",trs8yh,22,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/trs8yh/in_a_world_of_scarcity_panicbuying_of_things_in/

They also have huge PGM+gold assets in South Africa and return all of the profit to shareholders, giving them a P/E of 5 and dividend yield of 10%. You basically get that for free.

I can't wrap my head around the basic, apparently universal concept that ""options are rarely exercised"". The premise of this saying is that the majority of options trading involves buying and selling options as opposed to exercising them for the underlying stocks - in other words, people who trade options are far more likely to be looking for profits in terms of how much they can re-sell an option for after buying it, hopefully re-selling it to someone else at a much higher price. 

What I don't understand about this is, surely somebody must *eventually* exercise ITM options, otherwise they would be entirely worthless right from the get-go? Hypothetically speaking if an option is going to expire ITM this coming Friday, and it's just being bought and re-sold again and again by different people as the value increases, at *some* point on Friday, *somebody* is going to be the last person holding it and faced with the choice of either exercising it, or having it expire worthless?

In that context, how is it possible that most options are never exercised at all? Does that essentially mean that your average options contract is a bizarre game of pass the parcel with somebody inevitably left holding the unopened parcel at the end of the game?

If the rule of thumb was ""most *traders* don't exercise options and instead make money on the trading thereof"", that would make perfect sense. But the idea that most options themselves are left to expire unexercised while people have still made money buying and selling them seems very strange to me, as I don't understand why anyone would buy an option that's on the brink of expiry if they had no plans to exercise, but not enough time to sell it on to someone else.

Am I missing something here? Or is the phrase ""options are rarely exercised"" an inaccurate way of saying ""options *traders* rarely exercise""?",u2xet9,31,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u2xet9/options_are_rarely_exercised_why_exactly_does_the/

1633,The curious story of how CUSIP numbers became a Wall Street battleground,Industry News,"They may not be the most exciting part of the securities markets, but CUSIP numbers are indispensable. 

The arcane nine-digit ID numbers, issued by the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures, show up on everything from stocks, bonds, exchange-traded securities and mutual funds. They’re also not free. In at least two class-action lawsuits, investors are alleging that the cost of CUSIPs has been artificially inflated for decades, as a result of monopolistic control by data providers including the American Bankers Association, FactSet and S&P Global.

Investors, who are seeking injunctions and damages, allege the CUSIP system’s owners and exclusive licensees aggressively sought to dampen competition from other services offering free or lower-cost alternatives.

“The motive for their exclusion of competition is simple,” says [one of the complaints](https://www.law360.com/articles/1470933/s-p-accused-of-monopolizing-use-of-securities-id-numbers) filed recently in Manhattan federal court, “CUSIPs are worthless except for the fact that they are the standard.”

## How the CUSIP system began

CUSIPs have been standard since the 1960s for identifying securities for clearing and settlement of trades. The system is owned by the ABA and a subsidiary of S&P’s Global Market Intelligence, now called Factset Research Systems, which [completed its purchase](https://investor.factset.com/news-releases/news-release-details/factset-completes-acquisition-cusip-global-services) of the business from S&P this month for $1.925 billion. 

The numbering system was originally a subscription service that provided physical books containing information on every financial instrument linked to a CUSIP and were updated quarterly or annually. But in the 1980s, vendors like Bloomberg began distributing the data directly and electronically to financial institutions, making it unnecessary to pay a fee to S&P.

To counter the loss of revenue, S&P changed its business model from a subscription service to a licensing one, and required financial firms using CUSIPs to pay substantial fees. S&P inserted language in its contracts with data vendors requiring them to cut off access to the CUSIPs for any financial institution that did not enter into a license agreement with S&P.

At about the same time, according to the lawsuits, ABA and S&P became more aggressive in trying to maintain their stranglehold on the system.

“Monopolies are rarely good for business,” said Ronald J. Aranoff, a partner in the Litigation & Dispute Resolution Group at Wollmuth Maher & Deutsch LLC, which represents plaintiff Hildene Capital Management. “We trust the court to decide whether the exercise of monopoly power here was unlawful. We believe it is.”

## Flexing monopoly power

CUSIP was designated as a financial standard by a committee of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), dubbed X9. But X9 is hardly an independent body, at least according to the class action suits. The ABA established X9 during the 1970s and it, as well as S&P’s CUSIP Global Services, are still connected to X9 through voting positions on the committee’s board of directors.

Hildene is an institutional asset manager headquartered in Stamford, Conn. Like all other investment managers and traders, it requires access to financial information for managing, monitoring, buying, and selling financial instruments. The company typically pays Bloomberg for access to data that includes CUSIP numbers. For Hildene, the cost of getting the data with CUSIP numbers ends up being about $10,500 a year.

“Hildene…\[is\] then left with two unenviable options: pay S&P’s supracompetitive subscription rates or have CUSIP numbers stripped from their data feed and suffer, at a minimum, significant disruption to their businesses,” the lawsuit states.

US weekly jobless claims came in at 187,000, the lowest number since 1969, a sign that the labor market continues improving despite the disruption by Omicron earlier in the year.

In geopolitical news, the US and allies will expand sanctions against Russia in response to its unwarranted invasion of Ukraine. The new sanction target hundreds of members of the Russian parliament and the CEO of the largest bank in the country. Most significantly, the US Department of the Treasury warned that any gold-related transactions involving Russia may be sanctionable by US authorities. 

A senior administrator at the Treasury said, “Our purpose here is to methodically remove the benefits and privileges Russia once enjoyed as a participant in the international economic order.” As a reminder, Russia has already been expelled from the SWIFT international payment system, which essentially freezes banks from sending or receiving transactions. 

The initiatives come as President Joe Biden and NATO allies convene in Brussels for a series of summits to discuss the conflict.

In Russia, the stock market reopened after nearly a month-long shutdown to resume trading in 33 securities, including gas giant Gazprom and Sberbank, the largest bank in Russia.  The Central Bank banned short-selling on stocks, however, and prohibited foreign investors from selling stocks. The benchmark MOEX index (IMOEX.ME) gained as much as 10% in early trading.

The White House in a statement early Thursday called the re-opening a ""charade,"" and noted the government was ""artificially propping up the shares of companies that are trading."" Takes one to know one I guess. 

In the US, the Federal Reserve has the inevitable task of reigning in the fastest pace of inflation in over forty years without tanking the economy and plunging us into a recession. To that end, last week, the Federal Reserve raised the interest by 0.25% from near-zero levels for the first time since 2018 and committed to shrinking the balance sheet.

This week, stocks have oscillated between gains and losses after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed was prepared to raise the interest rate more aggressively than originally telegraphed. He said the Fed was ready to “take necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability. In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm)

John Lynch, Chief Investment Management at Comerica Wealth Management, said “Policymakers were more hawkish than anticipated, exceeding estimates for interest rates and inflation while reducing forecasts for economic growth. The era of quantitative easing is seemingly over, and quantitative tightening has begun. Though the policy dynamics are shifting, we encourage investors to continue to focus on the long-term fundamentals supporting growth in the economy and corporate profits.” 

Tightening also risks bringing the yield curve, the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates of fixed-income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, closer to inverting. An inverted yield curve, when the short-term rates exceed the long-term rates, has been a signal of a pending economic recession in the past. Here is what that means: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp)

Despite the Fed’s move to raise rates providing some temporary clarity to traders who for months have awaited steps forward on monetary tightening, geopolitical turmoil in Eastern Europe and potential economic impact toll continue to muddy the Fed’s already difficult fight to reign in record inflation. In particular, we have seen the price of crude oil and other commodities skyrocket, leading to record gas prices. February’s CPI numbers did not price in these increases, which means next month’s inflation ready is likely to come in worse, probably somewhere around 8.3 - 8.5%.

1636,Investing in Awesome Companies You Don't Like,,"Hi all, hopefully the title isn't misleading.  😅

Let me specific: I've never been an Apple product owner.  I don't like the walled garden and I don't like Apple's generally anti-consumer behavior.  For the most part, I can't do my work nor can I play video games on a Mac.  All that said, I absolutely respect Apple's driving force behind many industries.  I'm most impressed with their innovation in silicon, but they push every industry they touch forward.

Does it make sense for me to invest in Apple, even if I don't particular like them?  I respect them.  They do incredible stuff, but I really dislike the idea of driving the share price (even if by one-millionth of a percent) of a company that wouldn't respect me or consumers' collective dollars.

Thoughts on this predicament?  How do you invest in great companies that aren't good for their consumers or have other distasteful business practices, even if they're doing really compelling stuff elsewhere?

Maybe this is the totally wrong perspective and a good investing opportunity, regardless of what goes on behind the scenes, is just that.  Is this a *it's the only game in town* situation?

Apple is just an example, but there are many more I can think of.  Silicon and CPUs are really my circle of competence, but maybe I can extend that a little more to technology generally.  Another obvious one is Nvidia, (though, full disclosure, I *do* use Nvidia GPUs both at work and at home.)",thmg48,20,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/thmg48/investing_in_awesome_companies_you_dont_like/
1637,Norges Bank (NORWAY) - Potentially Something HUGE Here,Industry Discussion,"Look, I'm not hyperbolic like many schmoes on here. Heck, I'm the boring $DGX DD guy. **But something MASSIVE potentially just happened today involving Norges Bank (central bank of Norway).** I am 99% sure they divested from multiple (possibly all?) US stock holdings at the closing bell today. No, I don't know what this means....but I do know there is breaking news TODAY regarding a US military plane going down in NORWAY during ""planned"" NATO exercises. Maybe just a coincidence, but this divestiture is big news regardless of the cause anyway.

For context, Norges Bank holds (or held) very substantial positions in multiple US staples. One of which is **Verizon $VZ** at $2 BILLION, making them one of the largest shareholders period. Another company is **Colgate $CL** where they were in for $700m. **Basically Norges owned 1% of both of these companies, which is certainly a material amount.**

**So how did I figure all this out?** Keeping it as brief as possible so I don't spend my entire Friday night on reddit. In the last 5 minutes of trading today, $VZ volume went through the roof out of nowhere and the stock dropped an additional 2%. All happened in literally a few minutes. This isn't normal obviously. No one seemed to know who, why, or what caused it so I start looking for other companies with similar movement today. **I quickly notice Colgate had the exact same thing happen at the exact same time as Verizon.** Now I'm interested. This is two companies in entirely different spaces and both are relatively safe defensive dividend stocks with ZERO news on the day.

So I go look at institutional filings for both $VZ and $CL. What do ya know? Norges Bank's previously listed shares tie practically perfectly to the abrupt volume spike for both Verizon and Colgate. Norges Bank divested entirely from enormous positions in these companies. **They did it suddenly and in a kneejerk move because no institution or fund would unwind positions of that size all at once.** You are guaranteed to take the largest loss possible doing this / hurt your value.

They may have divested from multiple other companies as well, but I haven't had a chance to dive deeper. The question is why? Did they get underwater in another position? Margin called? Geopolitics? That's for reddit to decide....and me when I have more time to dive in.

**Post edit below since some folks have comprehension issues:** 

Interesting how flat out stupid most of the replies here are, so let me clear some things up:

1. sadly, many of you have no idea what you are doing in the market and just blindly reference terms you don't even understand like quad witching. Like parrots of some crappy investment blog
2. this was historic volume on both stocks. Yes, HISTORIC. And it occurred on a no news day and on 2 unrelated stocks in a 5 minute window. It is pathetic you boobs won't even do a second of due diligence, because if you did, you'd realize just how rare this movement was. It is not simply quad witching.
3. **I very clearly, multiple times, said I have no idea what the justification for the sudden divestiture was.** ""Maybe just a coincidence, but this divestiture is big news regardless of the cause anyway."" ""They may have divested from multiple other companies as well, but I haven't had a chance to dive deeper. The question is why? Did they get underwater in another position? Margin called? Geopolitics? That's for reddit to decide....and me when I have more time to dive in.""
4. It absolutely was Norges Bank and the fact that many of you can't figure that out after I led you to water is hysterical
5. But this is the same place that ignored / repeatedly deleted my $DGX analysis last year that made multiple redditors great money. Receipts still in post history.

In closing, maybe this is why so few people that are actually financially literate post here. Good luck. Totally normal to divest 1% ownership of a blue chip stock like $VZ 2 weeks before it goes ex-dividend at 5%. Totally happens all the time. LOL. Even if this is simply a massive rebalancing of their portfolio, it is still something useful to know/understand.",thk2ry,19,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/thk2ry/norges_bank_norway_potentially_something_huge_here/

1643,What’s the argument against going COST over total market index funds?,Company Discussion,"COST has destroyed the market’s returns for a while now. It’s an extremely stable company with lots of room for growth. Perhaps more importantly, especially right now, it holds up pretty well in a bear market. Of course there is still risk in investing in this company alone, but is a total market ETF really a better move? Would you not be beating the market if you invested in something like COST during a recession?

For example I have built my own portfolio for the most part but I still have around 15% in a total market ETF. Would it be stupid to sell and buy COST (and similar companies that fair well in this type of market)? 

I’m interested in hearing some thoughts on the matter.

Edit: I recognize that COST is just one company and broad ETFs are many. Obviously there is a lot of unsystematic risk with that, especially long term.

This tax problem hasn’t arisen for people who hold these so-called target date funds in tax-sheltered accounts — workplace retirement accounts like 401(k)s, or I.R.A.s. But for investors holding target date funds in ordinary, taxable accounts, it’s a different story.

One man in California who sent me copies of his Vanguard account data on the condition that he not be identified has an unexpected tax bill of more than $70,000 this tax season.

The simple answer is that a series of seemingly routine actions taken by Vanguard that lowered costs for the majority of shareholders who own these funds in retirement accounts resulted in unexpected bills for everyone else.

Vanguard, which has in the past been happy to discuss the merits of its target date funds, declined to comment about them for this column.

1653,$MOO - An interesting play on agriculture/fertilizer,Industry Discussion,"The Vaneck Vectors Agribusiness ETF is a fund that holds positions in **Deere & Co, Bayer AG, Nutrien and several other big name agribusiness suppliers, manufacturers and processors. $MOO has been on an upward trajectory for 5 years and has seen nearly 9% growth over the last 3 months. Overall, the ETF is considered a *safe* investment to keep in your portfolio for long term prospects. Recent volatile movement in the ETF has been mainly attributed to rising inflation, agricultural foods, fertilizers and the cost of distribution due to sharply rising oil prices.

As we all know, inflation is here to stay with the fed expecting more rate hikes this year. It's obvious that with inflation, businesses have no choice but to pad their profits and raise prices. We're experiencing this right now in the US and across the world.

The three largest holdings in the portfolio of $MOO is Deere, Bayer AG and Nutrien as mentioned earlier. Nutrien ($NTR) is the largest producer of *potash* and the third largest producer of *nitrogen fertilizer* in the world. Bayer AG ($BAYRY) is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world and has extensive outreach in agricultural chemicals, seeds and biotech products. Overall, the $MOO ETF has around **1.2 billion in assets**. 

One of the most important things to mention in this post is that UAN 38 and UAN 32 has moved over 140% and 144%, respectively, since last year (nitrogen fertilizers). Potash has risen just over 100%. Fertilizers alone are highly impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war fiasco in which **Russia exports account for 18% of the world's potash market, 20% of ammonia sales and 15% of urea**. Oh, and just a reminder... Fertilizer has been sanctioned as an export from Russia. These numbers give a direct reason to be invested in the space, at least for the next several months. 

If you're looking to make a play on the everrising prices of fertilizer and different commodities in the agribusiness sector then I'd love for you to do your own DD on $MOO. Options Implied Volatility is super low, even months out, while non-ETF focused stocks in the agribusiness sector are seeing insanely high IVs - and this means **that $MOO is a play you can actually get in early on before volume starts taking over**.

The thing is that before each of us made an investment we would consult each other to see if we thought it seemed right. There were times when he would invest and I wouldn't because I didn't think the stock was a good pick and he thought the same about some of my picks. Nevertheless, most of our portfolio was similar.

Now he sold part if his portfolio a few months ago and switched to several ETF's because of some life choices, so I'm more on my own when it comes to buying.

1667,$PARA undervalued? - Paramount +,Company Discussion,"I want to know what people's thoughts are on this.  Paramount + saw a huge bump in subscribers last quarter, outpacing Netflix and is also now in the top 25 app downloads on the google playstore.  
.

What i find interesting is that Paramount + 2021 total revenue was $28B with a net income of $4.5B, market cap of $24.5B.  
  

On the other hand, Netflix has 2021 revenues of $29B and net income of $5B, market cap of $166B.   

-
.


So if the revenues, net income are nearly identical between the two companies and paramount + is now outpacing netflix in subscribers, is it fair to say this is a very undervalued stock?  Netflix is essentially valued at 6.5X right now.  A morning star report all noted that Paramount + was one of the fastest growing brands in 2021.  I've seen commercials on tv for Paramount + too advertising Halo which ive heard has a been a huge hit.",ttd4qc,18,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ttd4qc/para_undervalued_paramount/

Folks, I watched ETF Edge today and discovered that FINRA is considering additional rules on leverage products (calling them ""complex products""). One of the things they are suggesting is to add a test exam for Retail Investors as a way to make sure that they understand risks that come with Leverage. They might even go one step further to enforce 1 day buy-n-hold limit trading limit for Retail investors. I personally disagree with this and before conventional financial advisors fill it up with ""yes, we need more regulation"" to serve their own interest, I want to bring this to your attention. The FINRA notice is currently seeking comments from the public, on what they think should be done and whether current oversight is enough.

I want to bring this to the attention to all the members here as we all have this topic very close to our investment strategies. Below is the link, Click on Comment to leave one :

1670,The new EU gas & Oil supplier *discussion*,,"Hi team, just another part timer trying to generate some alpha and thought I’d throw this out to the group.

Here are the facts:

- Whatever the outcome is in Ukraine (long duration vs short, Ukraine ‘win’ vs Russia, peaceful vs violent resolution etc) the one truth is the EU will change it’s supplier of LNG/ oil from Russia.

- The EU has now vowed to buy its LNG & oil as a block (as opposed to having individual countries compete as before).

- This means that there are some BIG contracts that will be agreed in the future (I’m assuming discussions are already heavily under way).

- With the current inflation levels, commodities are considered ‘safe havens’ and so are related stocks.

I’m trying to find who and where this/these producers will be- it’s easy to just say ‘US’ or ‘Saudi’ but, with countries such as Nigeria publicly bidding , I thought I’d throw it out for discussion.",tpuvr3,19,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tpuvr3/the_new_eu_gas_oil_supplier_discussion/

>Li-Cycle recognizes revenues using an Enron-like mark-to-model accounting gimmick. Li-Cycle recognizes revenues months prior to the actual sales of its recycled black mass, based on its own provisional estimate of the future value of the product. This accounting treatment is plainly vulnerable to abuse, giving Li-Cycle discretion over its reported revenues. We suspect that under this framework, Li-Cycle marks up the value of its receivables on unsold products and runs the gains through its revenue line. In the most recent quarter, we calculate that **45% of Li-Cycle’s revenues were derived from simply marking up receivables on products that had not been sold**.  
>  
>We suspect that such questionable accounting could explain why **Li-Cycle’s CFO and auditor resigned in January 2022**, mere months after the Company went public. Li-Cycle is a governance nightmare. Its founder is a serial penny stock promoter recently sanctioned by Canadian authorities and its management team **diverted half a million in shareholder money to enrich their entourage with wasteful spending, including tens of thousands of dollars on leather goods purchased from the CEO’s family**.  
>  
>Li-Cycle’s cash burn is so severe and far above previous guidance that analysts have already downgraded the stock and told the market to expect Li-Cycle to raise at least $1 billion through debt and dilutive equity issuances. By our calculation, Li-Cycle’s stated capital investments will require the Company to raise at least $1 billion – 102% of its current enterprise value – in large part by massively diluting current shareholders. We think Li-Cycle, which currently trades at 96.8x LTM revenues.  
>  
>**Chairman a Serial Penny Stock Promoter Recently Sanctioned by Canadian Regulators**. Li-Cycle’s co-founder and chairman, Tim Johnston, is a serial penny stock promotor who was recently banned by the TSX Venture exchange from acting as a director or officer of any TSXV-listed company without prior approval due to misconduct as president and CEO of Desert Lion Energy (DLI.CN). Johnston was sanctioned for failing to disclose key terms of a discounted financing he arranged for the junior miner. The British Columbia Securities Commission recently upheld the punishment. Undeterred, Johnston listed another lithium hype story on a junior Canadian exchange, which is down 62% from its highs and already admitted to overstating its cash balance.  
>  
>**Half a Million in Investor Money Diverted to Family Entourage**. Despite a business that is hemorrhaging cash, and which will require multiple near-term cash infusions, Li-Cycle diverted $529,902 in investor capital to the family entourage of its founders through a series of highly questionable related party payments. These payments include, $85,824 to a leather goods maker owned by the CEO’s family which makes wallets, toiletry bags and beer holsters. Li-Cycle also paid C$4,500 per month to lease part of a C$312,000 office from the CEO’s family, paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to a corporate video production company owned by the chairman’s brother and paid over $170,000 to a family owned “technology service” with three employees in India.  
>  
>**Li-Cycle’s Revenues are based on Enron-esque Mark-to-Model Accounting**. Li-Cycle claims to sell 100% of its recycled black mass to an investor, Traxys, and recognizes revenues immediately upon delivery. But Traxys is not really a customer, it is merely a broker providing working capital financing to Li-Cycle while Traxys attempts to sell Li-Cycle’s black mass to end buyers. Traxys is not the end customer, it bears no commodity price risk, and charges Li-Cycle interest on any cash to the Company prior to final sale to the end buyer. Yet Li-Cycle somehow recognizes revenue immediately upon delivery to its brokers, months before any sale occurs. Li-Cycle’s revenues are based on its own provisional estimate of the value of its unsold recycled product. In our opinion, Li-Cycle’s accounting is reminiscent of Enron – as the Company’s revenues are not derived from bona fide sales of recycled product to end customers, but rather Li-Cycle’s estimates of the future value of such products. Li-Cycle in effect uses markto-model accounting, pulling sales forward from future periods and recognizing revenues based on its self-serving estimates of recycled product shipped to its brokers. Under this framework, Li-Cycle also bolsters reported revenues by marking up the value of receivables for black mass which sits at its brokers and has yet to be sold. In the most recent quarter, we calculate that 45% of Li-Cycle’s revenues were derived from simply marking up receivables on products that had not been sold. We question whether this highly aggressive accounting treatment caused Li-Cycle’s auditor and CFO to resign, both of whom abruptly left the Company following the end of the last fiscal year.  
>  
>**Li-Cycle Requires $1 Billion in Near Term Capital**. Li-Cycle’s costs and anticipated capital expenditures have ballooned. Morgan Stanley estimated in a recent note downgrading the stock that cost and capital expense overruns increased its estimate of Li-Cycle’s free cash flow burn (2022-2026) from $643 million to \~$1.85 billion, a 3x increase. Analysts estimate that Li-Cycle burns cash so much more rapidly than it initially told investors, that the Company will need to raise $1 billion in additional capital through debt and dilutive equity issuances. We agree. By our calculation, Li-Cycle’s proposed capital investments will require the Company to raise at least $1 billion – 102% of its current enterprise value – in part by diluting existing shareholders. This is fatal to the bull case for the stock: even if investors ignore Li-Cycle’s nightmarish corporate governance, questionable accounting, and negative margins, they will likely be so badly diluted that even if they win, they lose.  
>  
>**Hiding Negative Gross Margins**. Notably for a self-styled ‘urban miner,’ Li-Cycle does not disclose gross margins on its income statement, instead reporting nebulous expense categories which on the surface, seem to imply an impressive 83% gross margin in the latest quarter. We think this is highly misleading, as the footnotes to the financial statements reveal that LiCycle’s aggregate inventory costs exceeded its aggregate revenues since inception. This suggests that Li-Cycle likely has negative gross margins, indicating that its recycling business is neither scalable nor economically viable. Rising commodity prices are unlikely to help, as the cost of Li-Cycle’s inputs will simply rise along with commodity prices.  
>  
>**Blood Diamonds and ESG**. Li-Cycle’s purported commitment to ESG is central to its narrative, a commitment which we believe is more of a marketing ploy than a guiding tenet. Li-Cycle’s advisor, major shareholder and company consultant owned a Tanzanian diamond mine which has been accused of appalling human rights abuses. We question how ESG investors will feel about the ESG credentials of a company with close ties to a group accused of profiting from blood diamonds.",tnw3yz,18,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tnw3yz/licycle_business_hemorrhaging_cash_and_has/

1675,Question: Why are residential mortgages primarily fixed rate over 30 years if inflation constantly eats at this fixed yield?,Industry Question,"Let’s assume that a lender originates a fixed 30 year mortgage loan at 4% today.
If inflation is kept at 2% like the FED ideally would like (let’s assume the world is perfect and this rate can be kept locked for the full 30 years), that means that the 4% rate on the mortgage and thus the yearly total payments the lender is receiving, is losing 2% of its value every year. If we take a look at year 30, (let’s assume the borrower never refinances or sells the property) the lenders effective rate has fallen to 2.18% for the final year.

Why do lenders originate fixed rate mortgages if the fixed rate will begin to lose value almost immediately upon origination and ultimately the desired yield is significantly lower towards the end of the loans life?

Do they instead price the rate higher, let’s say 6%, so that after 30 years of inflationary loss the yield is actually 4%?

Was wondering this, thanks in advance for the input!

1679,"U.S. Online Retail Sales to Hit $1 Trillion in 2022, Study Says",Industry News,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/us-online-retail-sales-51647030830?mod=hp\_INTERESTS\_consumer&refsec=hp\_INTERESTS\_consumer](https://www.barrons.com/articles/us-online-retail-sales-51647030830?mod=hp_INTERESTS_consumer&refsec=hp_INTERESTS_consumer)

U.S. consumers will spend $1 trillion in online shopping in 2022, the highest level ever, according to a new study by [Adobe ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/adbe).  

The software company’s study, part of its ongoing Adobe Digital Economy Index series, found that U.S. consumers spent $1.7 trillion online in the first two years since the start of the pandemic, from March 2020 through February 2022. That was almost triple the online sales in 2018 and 2019 combined of $609 billion. 

Adobe (ticker: ADBE) estimates total 2021 U.S. online sales were $885 billion, up 9% from the $813 billion recorded in 2020, which was up 41% from $575 billion in 2019.

Adobe also found clear evidence of online inflation throughout the period, with prices rising for 21 consecutive months—and the effect is becoming more severe. In 2020, Adobe found, incremental online spending over the 2019 level totaled $237.9 billion, including $4.7 billion in spending simply due to higher prices. 

More startling was the finding that of the $72.2 billion of incremental online spending in 2021, $22.2 billion reflected higher prices. Adobe expects the recent pattern to continue in 2022, with higher prices projected to add $27 billion to online growth this year.

Another key finding of the survey was that the pandemic has spurred a “breakout” for online grocery sales, not surprising with many people sheltering in place and choosing to buy everyday goods online for delivery rather than visiting supermarkets and other retail stores.

In 2020, Adobe says, online grocery shopping in the U.S. grew 103%, to $73.7 billion. Growth has since moderated. The total reached $79.7 billion last year, and is projected to top $85 billion this year.

Adobe found that electronics remains the largest category for online shopping, at $165 billion in 2021, up 8% from 2020. Electronics was 18.6% of overall e-commerce last year, down from 18.8% in 2020 and 21% in 2019, largely a reflection of growth in other categories.

Items being sold out remain an issue for many shoppers, Adobe found. During the pandemic period, the rate at which consumers see out-of-stock messages has increased by 235%.

The Adobe Digital Economy Index is based on more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and covers over 100 million individual products across 18 product categories.",teqpwa,19,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/teqpwa/us_online_retail_sales_to_hit_1_trillion_in_2022/

Some example:

* Costco: People gravitates towards bulk buying and Kirkland brands during tough economic times. However, Costco still has a ton of room to grow. Charlie Munger said Costco can become an online retailer challenger to Amazon.

* Walmart: Walmart is quietly building up their online offerings and delivery service. I personally use their grocery delivery service and it isn't terrible. Maybe 3 to 5 years from now they can be the #2 online retailer after Amazon and Costco.

* LMT: Defense spending is not likely to go down any time soon. Plus LMT also have divisions for space exploration, automation, AI, energy storage, and cybersecurity. The only down side is that this stock is already through the roof due to current Russian aggression.

I held 500 shares of $Zim until Friday, and sold all but a small holding. I made a lot of money off of zim, up 32% at the time I sold, but my question is on the $17 dividend. There will be a 25% tax withholding only netting us around $12 a share, but the stock will pull back $17.

1692,Cybersecurity Stock Tips,Industry Discussion,"I like the industry as a whole, so I compiled some information that I focused on when I was choosing which companies to buy. I majored in computer network and security, have been on a sales team which sold cybersecurity solutions to government agencies, and my close relative is a CISO of an MNC, so I sort of understand the background of how the industry works from both the sales, technical, and customer part. 

There are many different solutions with many companies in each solution, so find a solution you're thinking of investing. There are four main layers companies look at when structuring their defence; network, endpoints, application, data. Each layer has sublayers that requires different forms of protection, creating many small niches that requires a cybersecurity solution. For example, endpoint solutions has endpoint detection and response (EDR) which involves stopping and remediating attacks happening on PCs (where Crowdstrike and SentinelOne are in), or endpoint management which enforces policies and regulations on PCs (Tanium and Bigfix). Some other solutions are SASE, SWG, CASB, ZTNA, SIEM, NDR, MDM. It's good to dive into a particular solution, instead of looking at cybersecurity as a whole as it's too broad. 

There are some companies that has a foot in different solutions, like how Zscaler provides both ZTNA and SWG solutions (two of the many solutions that are on the network defence layer), but generally you're looking at more than 5, or even 10 companies at each layer. You can look up something called Gartner Quadrants to see the who's leading a particular solution and the competing companies. An easy decider is picking the best company for a particular solution.

Side note: Companies in this industry are also at constant R&D war with each other. Losing out in developing newer technologies immediately puts you behind when companies are sourcing for solutions. As soon as a new solution goes onto the market with a strong solution, organisations would reaccess how this new solution may integrate and possibly solve more areas than existing solutions. Many are constantly on the lookout to improve existing infrastructure. Solutions can be phased out after 2 or 3 years if companies deem the solution as laggards. You have to constantly watch which solutions are being left behind, and keep track of solutions R&D steps to ensure your company stays relevant. Even the solution itself can be phased out by newer solutions, so do watch your company closely.

Contributions to your Roth IRA are not tax deductible since they come out of post tax money. But the deadline is the same.

While you're at it, you can also contribute for 2022. And since the markets are down, it might make sense to do that so that any money you make on that money in a recovery by next April doesn't cost you in taxes.

1699,ETF's long term investment for early retirement,,"Hi!  
We're both 30 and are looking at what to invest in to start an early retirement account and a safe 15-20 year investment for a child.  
We already max out 401k and IRA so now looking at taxable brokerage for retirement at 3k monthly contribution.  
We have a child due this year that we'd like to start at 500/monthly contribution as an idea they can use this for a down-payment. We will also be starting a college fund.  


We have some riskier investments from college that have done well and we haven't touched so I'm looking for both of these to be more stable.

We have about 70k in variable tech like AMD, AAPL, NVDA, OLED etc. Some people have recommended slowly moving this into other funds- we have held for more than a year. But I'm not sure that'd be worth the capital gains to do vs just sell when we want the money out?

For long term we have about 20k in SCHB but my plan is to do the following for early retirement:

70% SCHB  
20% SCHF  
5% SCHC  
5% SCHE

For child I have no idea so I'd appreciate some help in that one.

Thank you!

1701,Why do most investors/news treat stock buy backs announcements so different than dividends.,,"So personally I would much rather prefer a company to do stock buy backs vs dividends as it gives me the choice if I want to sell or take the tax hit. 

This sort of got me thinking why do dividends seem so much more news worthy and structured vs stock buy backs? It seems like with stock buy backs the BOD will say ""We authorize $X to be allocated to buy backs"" and this rarely makes much news, hell they may not even need to spend the full amount. Next year/quarter they may opt not to do buy backs and this seems not to really make news

With dividends on the other hand it seems it generates much more news, if a company cuts its dividend its BIG news. With some companies if they do not increase their dividend it is also big news. 

Just wondering why this is the case? For example there is a dividend aristocrat index, would it make sense to have a buy back aristocrat index to track companies that allocate more money every year to buy backs?

# [Stock futures edge lower after Dow and S&P 500 notch a fourth straight day of gains](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. equities futures dipped slightly Wednesday after stocks extended their rally in the previous session, even as fears of an inverted yield curve sparked recession concerns and investors continued watching developments play out in Ukraine.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 95 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.4%.
*****
> Russia said late Tuesday it would reduce its military presence in some parts of Ukraine, but several countries — including the U.S. and U.K. — remain skeptical over Moscow’s pledge. Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued Wednesday.
*****
> Crude prices, which have soared since the war began, climbed more than 2% to $106.57 per barrel on Wednesday. Germany warned of potential rationing of natural gas due to disputes with Russia.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a strong session, with the Dow and S&P 500 positing their fourth straight day of gains on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.8% in the previous session and now sits less than 10% from its record.
*****
> “The market’s now up almost 10% in the last 10 days, so we’ve had a pretty incredible rally in a very short time with not a whole lot of news change except that we actually have more rate hikes priced into the market,” Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, told CNBC.
*****
> “This has been a nice ride,” she added. “But I wouldn’t get too comfortable for the rest of this year, because I think we’re going to continue to see a lot of volatility.”
*****
> Several retail stocks were under pressure in premarket trading after disappointing quarterly reports, including Five Below and Chewy.
*****
> On the positive side, shares of chipmaker Micron rose 4% after the company beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Apparel stock Lululemon jumped 7% after issuing upbeat guidance and announcing a share buyback program.
*****
> All eyes were on the bond market Tuesday as the U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasury yields inverted Monday for the first time since 2016. Historically, this inversion has been a sign of a coming recession, though it hasn’t been a good indicator of when the recession would come. Still, investors largely shrugged off the event.
*****
> On Tuesday, the main yield spread traders watch, that between the 2-year and the 10-year rate, came close to inverting but stayed positive. On Wednesday, the spread climbed back to about 7 basis points.
*****
> “The big talk right now is that at any given point in time, recession can be on the horizon,” Lang said. “Typically, you won’t see a recession for an average of 20 months once a yield curve inverts. Our antennas are up that recession risk is heightened; that doesn’t necessarily mean that there’ll be one this year, though next year is more of a concern for us.”
*****
> Investors will be watching economic data scheduled to be released Wednesday, including economic growth data, home sales data and ADP’s national employment report.
*****
> Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, will speak to the Economic Club of New York.

1705,Opinions on LOVE right now?,Company Analysis,"Love have been posting insane numbers for their earnings over the last few years, and have significantly grown both their net income and revenue over the past year alone, 211% and 55% respectively. Despite this, they're only up 12% today and flat over the last year. They don't carry much debt, and are rocking a low 19 PE ratio. I've bought myself 11 shares worth, but as I watch the price drop, I'm extremely tempted to double down on this. They show no signs of slowing down, and there was no indication of that in their latest earnings call. I believe they also mentioned a backlog of orders, which could be hiding the true income figure. Nevertheless, I don't see how this isn't a perfect buying opportunity. 

With such little share growth whilst having such insane revenue and income growth, I find it hard to see why their share price isn't closer to it's ATH.",tr9vg4,16,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tr9vg4/opinions_on_love_right_now/
1706,How likely is it for stocks to suffer hard if fed interest rates rise significantly this year?,Advice,"If interest rates go up that means people will probably put their money into bonds or banks right? Does that mean it should be obvious to us that it won't be a strong market?

Based on recent history this definitely seems to be the case. They had an aggressive rate hike recently (2019) and it started to hurt the market. Then the market suffered during covid but the fed was miraculously able to save the market by taking alot of action. The question is can the stock market survive the feds tapering and the rise of interest rates? 

 The word tapering itself is very fitting. Tapering is a term that is also used to describe people who are trying to slowly come off drug addiction. There's good amount of evidence to suggest that the market is addicted to the feds support. You only have to look at the ridiculous rise in stock prices from just before COVID to now. For example Tesla went from 150$ in February 2020 to a ridiculous 1000 this week. It just doesn't make sense that something could rise that much during a crisis.  Amd went from 45$ to 120$ during the same time frame. The sp500 went up about 25% and the dow 18%. The  Vanguard Total Stock Market Index is an accumulation of every us stocks price into one index. It went from 78$- 112$ per share within the same time frame. That might not seem like much but it's about 35-40 percent rise. 

Another thing to consider is that the fed might believe that some degree of this inflation is transitory. This could lead to a less aggressive rate hike which could be good for stocks. The problem with that assumption is that many analysts have been predicting 5-6 rate hikes which would be about 2-2.5 percent.",tpwala,16,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tpwala/how_likely_is_it_for_stocks_to_suffer_hard_if_fed/

I bought ADBE on margin after that ~25% down day hoping for a quick bump and ended up bag holding. I’m down about 15% and am wondering if I should keep holding or cut my losses. I’m nervous about another significant drop after earnings but it might go up so I don’t know what to do.

1709,How much do companies/employees actually care about stock price?,,"It's quite common to read ""X company did this to boost their stock price"", ""Y company announced that for pump their stock"" etc... I'm wondering how much of this is true. I've worked in a few publicly traded companies and people just don't care about the stock. I have never heard anyone talk about the daily price action or seen information about the stock. Most people don't even care about the earnings report.

I work in communication and we have screens all over the company to inform employees about the company's ongoings. Never has it been even discussed to throw up a stock chart on the screen. I have meetings with people all over the company and I have never stumbled into an office with people scrutinizing the stock price. I have never been asked to do anything ""for the stock price"". I have never made a huge announcement and thought with my colleagues ""let's see how the stock reacts"".

So here's my question: is the whole idea of companies keeping a close eye on the stock price overblown? 

I know ultimately companies want the stock to go up, I'm questioning the idea of acting on anything for short term gains.",tjyvim,15,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tjyvim/how_much_do_companiesemployees_actually_care/

$10k in VOO and QQQ

$4k in Upstart

$5k in Tesla

$5k in Shopify, Rivian, Beyond Meat, Nio, Xpeng, Disney, MSFT, Google. (About $2k of that is in Google)

The remaining in random companies like United Healthcare, Berkshire Hathaway, some REITs, all 1 or 2 shares or fractional shares.

I'm so lost on what to do. I'm already down thousands since I started investing late last year. I am worried I'll lose another $10k once the recession hits.

1719,Kindred Group (KIND SDB) Analysis… Worth the Gamble?,,"*Disclaimer:* huge bricks of text coming up...

**Stock Valuation:** 

European comps 888 Holdings, Entain Plc, and Flutter Entertainment trade at avg. multiples of 17.9x EBITDA and 3.5x sales.  888 Holdings is half the size of Kindred on a revenue basis, and a quarter of the size on an EBITDA basis. Entain is 2.5x larger than Kindred on a revenue basis, but less than 2x its size on an EBITDA basis.  Flutter is 4.5x the size of Kindred on a revenue basis but only 2.5x its size on an EBITDA basis. These comparisons point to the significantly higher profitability of Kindred vis-à-vis its peers (discussed further below) US-domiciled comp DraftKings is slightly smaller than Kindred on a revenue basis and will lose approximately $615 million on an EBITDA basis this year.  DraftKings trades at 17x revenue.  

**Profitability Considerations vs. Competitors:** 

•	FanDuel (the US online sports betting segment of Flutter Entertainment) sales and marketing expense % of revenue is 42%.  It will not be EBITDA profitable until 2023.  DraftKings sales and marketing % of revenue is 65%.  They will not be EBITDA profitable until 2024.  DraftKings has publicly stated that it will take 2 to 3 years for each new customer acquisition to generate a positive profit contribution.

•	Kindred’s harnassing of “Big Data” to create efficiencies and “stickiness” in customer acquisition has led to a sales and marketing expense % of revenue of 21%, more than 50% below the ratio of its US competitors.  This is the reason Kindred has EBITDA margins of over 30%.  European comps have EBITDA margins in the mid 20s, and US comps, as shown above, continue to lose money.  These economies of scale have to do with Kindred’s huge head start in entering the online sports and casino gambling market, and its lead in exploiting the data generated and steady infrastructure built up over these years.  Kindred Group was founded in 1997 (same year as 888 Holdings), while Entain was founded in 2004, FanDuel was founded in 2009, and DraftKings in 2012.  Kindred Group and the Europeans clearly saw this opportunity earlier.

•	Kindred generates 67% of its revenue in Western Europe, 31% in ROW (rest of world includes Eastern Europe, the Nordic Countries, Australia, and Asia), and 2% in the US.  (Attached chart shows geographic exposure of peer group)  Kindred, through its Unibet brand, has just won 2 additional state licenses in the US (Virginia and Arizona) and now is in a total of 6 states.  Unibet was recently chosen as the online sportsbook partner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Philadelphia Eagles. Generally, each state awards 7 to 8 licenses, and there are still 30 states that have not yet legalized online sports betting and gambling.  The break-down of US states presence is shown below:

&#x200B;

||Number of US States Operating in|States|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Kindred Group|6|VA, AZ, NJ, PA, IN, IA|
|DraftKings|13|NJ, WV, IN, NJ, MI, CO, IL, IA, NC, VA, PA, NH, TN|
|FanDuel|10| IL, CO, VA, PA, IN, WV, IA, NJ, TN, MI|
|Entain (BetMGM)  |10|MI, NV, NJ, IA, WV, IN, TN, CO, VA, PA|
|888 Holdings                                                                              |3|NJ, NV, DE |



•	The take-away here is that Kindred, which is the 3rd largest global online sports betting and casino gaming company, still has a miniscule share of the total market opportunity.  It will generate approximately $1,250 of revenue this year in Europe; $610 million of revenue in ROW; and $40 million in the US.  These represent market shares of 5.2% in Europe, 5.1% in ROW, and 0.3% in the US, which it just entered in 2021.   Growth going forward will be enormous.

**Short-Term Catalysts:** 

•	As of 09/21/21 Kindred’s revenue had already surpassed the revenue of last year’s entire third quarter.  In the third quarter of 2020 the economy had reopened post-covid, and there were a large number of live sporting events - so Q3 2021 was supposed to be up against very tough comps. The enormous increase in avg. revenue per day seen at the beginning of July was positively affected by the Euro Cup 2020 soccer tournament held through July 11. The key point is that the valuation and profit growth of Kindred are going to look even better than I have described.

**Long-Term Catalysts – The Balance Sheet, Shareholder Return Yield, and M&A:** 

•	Kindred has a 2.5% dividend yield (safe and growing) and a 50 million GBP share repurchase authorization. They have repurchased 16 million GBP shares year-to-date at an average cost of 146.00 SEK. They have an additional 34 million worth of shares to repurchase this year.

•	Assuming about 300 million GPB of free cash flow in 2021 (using their historical average free cash flow % of EBITDA) and Kindred’s goal of “returning 75% of free cash flow to shareholders every year,” this equates to a total return yield (dividend + buybacks) of 7.4%.  Investors will love to own an appreciating asset with a yield that dwarfs the 10-year US treasury yield of 1.3% and even lower government bond yields in Europe. 

•	Kindred’s fortress-like balance sheet and free cash flow retention makes M&A a continual opportunity for them.  They have identified several candidates in the US and believe that most new entrants will fail because they are too late to the party and don’t have the financial resources to build out the infrastructure, brand awareness, regulatory expertise, and data-driven marketing advantage that Kindred possesses.

•	Kindred is itself a very attractive take-over target for brick-and-mortar casino operators facing declining revenue growth, regulatory crackdown in Macau, trends in “stay-at-home consumption,” and an extremely late start at getting into the online gambling sector. Potential buyers include Wynn Resorts, Caesars, Las Vegas Sands, and Penn National Gaming.  A potential take-out of Kindred at a 15x forward EBITDA multiple (DraftKings just offered 19x forward EBITDA for Entain), would value KIND stock at 410 SEK.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:** 

I believe that this is a fantastic opportunity.  Kindred operates in one of the fastest growing industries globally (recession and inflation proof) and is the best run company in online sports betting and gambling.  It will generate profit and cash flow margins far in excess of its peers, and will use this cash flow to further strengthen its competitive moat and to return money to shareholders in a way that will give us very high fixed returns on top of massive capital appreciation potential.",u1lk8p,14,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u1lk8p/kindred_group_kind_sdb_analysis_worth_the_gamble/

1722,Visualizing the power of Dollar-Cost Averaging,,"I'd always heard the phrase, ""time in the market is more important than timing the market,"" but I had never been able to see how it would have played out. A few things I learned while doing my research:

If you had put some money in VTI consistently since 2013 (when I graduated from college, Go Blue), you would:

1. Be up 68% on your money
2. Have a max loss of just -3% (March 2020)

Had you done the same with QQQ:

1. 106% Return with **no** periods of negative return

And IWM:

1. 40% return with -23% max loss

Had you done the same thing with Bitcoin (just for fun), you would:

1. Be up 344%(!)
2. Have a max loss of -37%

&#x200B;

Takeaway: Did I do any of these things? No! But if you're a passive investor (like I am aspirationally), there's almost nothing you can do that's more effective than investing **regularly** (ideally in broad-market ETFs). 

&#x200B;

Stay the course!

1723,Is MP Materials ($MP) still a good buy?,Company Discussion,"I did a quick search, and it looks like it's been a while since MP had its own discussion thread.

Why I’m hesitant at first glance:

* trading near all-time highs
* P/E ratio of 76

In case you’re unfamiliar with them, here’s a snippet from their website:

“MP Materials helps fuel the electrification of global infrastructure. We are the largest producer of rare earth materials in the Western Hemisphere, through our state-of-the-art, zero-discharge operations in Mountain Pass, California. We currently deliver approximately 15% of global rare earth supply with a long term focus on Neodymium-Praseodymium (NdPr), a crucial input to the powering of electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones, robots and many other advanced technologies.”

And some a few reasons they’re making waves:

* YoY revenue and net income growth were easily in the triple digits for each quarter of 2021
* In February, the DoD signed a contract with MP for $35 million, trying to reinforce America’s supply chain of precious metals.
* In December, GM signed a long-term deal with MP for supplying materials, alloys, and magnets for its EV lineups.

I researched all the ETFs, actively managed, passively managed, CEFs, Emerging market ETFs, all of them.

However, none of them were a match for me, as most of them seem to have been trading sideways for decades and India's market PE ratio is also indication some overvaluation.

After being stuck in this paradox for weeks, I have stumbled upon india's largest bank: HDFC bank.

It has a pretty smooth upward trend and good fundamentals on paper.

I would like to hear your opinions on this bank, is it a good long term bet on India's economy?

Do you guys know of a better way to invest in India's growth?

Thanks.",tx13k0,14,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tx13k0/investing_in_indias_growth/
1725,Western Digital analysis and valuation - Is it time for a comeback? ($WDC),Company Analysis,"Western Digital is one of the companies that had terrible share price performance over the last 5 years, down over 40%.

This post is an attempt to understand the company's historical performance, how the company operates today, what's ahead of it, and finally, how much it is worth today.

&#x200B;

**What is Western Digital?**

In one sentence, this is a company that develops, manufactures, and provides data storage devices and solutions.

If there's one thing we know about data, it is that it keeps increasing, hence there's increased demand for solutions around it. These solutions are not only in personal computers and smart video systems, but in the last decade also in automotive, IoT, and various home applications.

So, we have a growing industry, yet, Western Digital's share price has declined from $80 to $50.

Attractive industries always attract more competitors. The higher the supply of products, the lower the price. Western Digital's sales experienced a huge drop during 2019 to $16.5b (compared to $20.6b the year before). The reason is oversupply and competition for flash-based products. 

It is worth mentioning that the innovation in this industry is very aggressive, so the value of the products is decreasing significantly when a new and better product is introduced. When faced with high competition and an oversupply of products, there's no option to defer the sale to a later point in time, as if that option is chosen, those products are likely to be sold at a loss.

&#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

The operating margin declined from 17.5% in 2018 to only 0.5% in 2019, all due to the drop in sales price and gross margin. Since then, the company started recovering. The operating margin increased to 2% in 2020, to 7.2% in 2021, and is up to 13.2% for the last twelve months.

If we measure the sales activities of the company through the cost of goods sold, it is quite clear that their activities didn't decline. The number of goods sold remained stable. The R&D as % of revenue remained stable and during the last 5 years, the company even reduced the SG&A from 25% to 20% of the total revenue.

However, one bad year was enough to cause fear among investors and question the ability of the company to innovate and stay on the top of its game. Although the company has been around for over 50 years, the innovation of new products is as important as it was on day 1.

&#x200B;

**Financial position**

During the last 5 years, there are a few points to be noted related to the financial position:

1. The cash position decreased from $5b to $2.5b. Not because they were losing money, but because of the following two points.
2. The debt decreased from $11b to $7b (excluding leases). This roughly means, they generated an additional $1.5b to pay down debt from their regular operations. (not to mention, up until 2020, they were paying dividends)
3. A slight increase in PPE - is always a good sign which means their capacities have increased.

So, if we compare the balance sheet 5 years ago and today, it is clear that the company is in a better position than it was. Yet, the share price is much lower.

&#x200B;

**What's next?**

If we take a look at the company's priorities, based on the investor presentation, they've noted three:

1. Reinvestment in the company - mainly through R&D - no doubt that this is the most important use of funds. If this is not done, there will be no profitable company to run in a few years.
2. Reduced debt - Although it is at an acceptable level, one of their priorities is to further reduce it.
3. Shareholder return (through Dividends/share repurchases) - The company was a dividend-paying company between 2013 and 2020. I would not be surprised if they start paying dividends again within 2 years.

The market size (both for flash-based products and HDD) is expected to grow at around 4-5% year over year and analysts are projecting double-digit revenue growth. This is in line with management's expectations for the next year.

However, taking the fact that the company is operating in a highly competitive industry, I do not feel comfortable forecasting double-digit growth after the next 12 months. 

&#x200B;

**Valuation - Key assumptions**

As the valuation is based on certain assumptions, here are mine:

**Revenue growth** \- 10% in the next 12 months, followed by 2.5% growth afterward (equal to the current risk-free rate)

**Operating margin** \- 13% for the next year, followed by 14%. Although the margin was over 17% in the past, and there's a chance the company will get back there, there's also a chance to encounter another bad year, such as 2019.

**Discount rate** \- 9% (Based on WACC)

**Outcome -** The company's fair value is $22.5b ($72.18/share) - slightly undervalued at the moment based on my assumptions

&#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are wrong?**

Based on my assumption, the company's revenue will grow by 37% in 10 years. However, I could be wrong.

So here are a couple of different scenarios related to the revenue and operating margin 10 years from now.

|Revenue / Op. margin|12%|14%|16%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|20% ($22.7b)|$55.3|$66.1|$76.9|
|37% ($25.2b)|$59.4|$72.2|$83.6|
|50% ($28.4b)|$62.3|$75.6|$88.9|
|100% ($37.9b)|$71.3|$88.5|$105.7|

In all of these scenarios, the company seems undervalued, in some more than others and it is quite clear that maintaining a high operating margin is more important than growing the revenue. If I am to invest in the company, I'll be more focused on the margins.

I hope you enjoyed the post, feel free to add your take on the company and provide feedback.",tunqre,15,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tunqre/western_digital_analysis_and_valuation_is_it_time/

1727,Thoughts on purchasing land and/or building a house in current housing market.,,"Hey y'all. I am 25 years old with a solid amount of capital from working 3 years after college as an engineer and not having much to any expenses due to living and working from home. 

Recently, I began looking at buying a plot of land in a neighborhood to build a house. The location will be very close to a new train station that is going to be built which more easily provides access to Chicago from Northwest Indiana. 

So my question for you guys is.... Do you think now is the right time to invest either in the plot of land itself, or buy the plot of land to build a house?

The neighborhood is a ""bring your own"" builder, so the houses that are there are very unique looking, everything is different. In my mind, this also makes it a solid value investment due to the location of the neighborhood (good area + new train station for ease of access to Chicago being built by 2024). 

As a young investor, I have been hesitant to jump too much into the market because fears of a bubble and ""crash"" that apparently has been looming for a few years. As a young investor, knowing the 2008 situation, but not KNOWING how a similar situation could affect me, is leaving me a little hesitant to move forward with buying the land / building the house. 

Is jumping in during this time wrong? Or should I wait for housing bubble to relax and construction costs to level out? 

I am open to any advice / discussion relating to the stock market / housing market!",ttmrf9,15,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ttmrf9/thoughts_on_purchasing_land_andor_building_a/

1730,(3/28) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a frrrrrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, March 28th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures are flat as a big week of economic data kicks off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures were steady Monday morning as a week filled with key economic reports kicked off, and investors continue to keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve’s planned interest rate hikes.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 points, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.1%.
*****
> Shares of Tesla popped more than 5% in premarket trading on Monday on news it wants to split its stock so it can pay a stock dividend to shareholders.
*****
> The Securities and Exchange Commission filing said Tesla will ask at its annual shareholders meeting “for an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock ... in order to enable a stock split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend.”
*****
> Elsewhere on Monday, parts of The Treasury yield curve inverted on Monday, raising some recession concerns. Earlier on Monday, the yield on the 5-year Treasury note rose to 2.6361%, while the 30-year yield was down less than 1 basis point to 2.6004%.
*****
> However, the main yield spread that traders watch — the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year rate — remained positive for now.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 rose on Friday to close out their second consecutive winning week. The Dow gained 153 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5% and has more than erased its losses since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2% but still finished the week in the green.
*****
> The moves came as investors continue to monitor developments in Russia’s war on Ukraine and expectations about the Fed’s plans to hike interest rates.
*****
> “It seems the skyrocketing move higher with commodity prices has taken a break and that has allowed investors a chance to pile back into equities,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Geopolitical risks remain very elevated and the rally in equities over the past two weeks is impressive. The U.S. economy is still in good shape, but buying every stock market dip probably won’t be the attitude for most traders going forward given how hawkish the Fed has turned.”
*****
> Investors continue to keep a close eye on the Fed. Wall Street firms from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America penciled in half-point hikes in future Fed meetings this year after the central bank’s chair Jerome Powell vowed to be tough on inflation and said rate increases could become more aggressive if necessary.
*****
> On Friday, the benchmark 10-year yield touched a fresh multi-year high of 2.5% as investors priced in a more aggressive rate hike cycle, which helped lift financial stocks while tech stocks pulled back.
*****
> Investors are looking forward to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, this week. The JOLTS report is one set of employment data that the Federal Reserve is watching closely as it tightens monetary policy. ADP will also release its private payrolls data ahead of the main show, the closely watched monthly jobs report, on Friday.
*****
> Monday is a light day for earnings reports but several big companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results this week, including BioNTech, Micron and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

*****
> U.S. stock futures fell Thursday morning, following back-to-back days of sharp gains, as investors digested the latest news out of Ukraine.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 100 points, or about 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The Kremlin poured cold water over reports that indicated progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, according to Bloomberg News.
*****
> On Wednesday, the Financial Time reported that both countries had made “significant progress” on a peace plan and Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. That FT report helped stocks rally for a second day Wednesday.
*****
> Wall Street was also digesting the latest moves from the Federal Reserve. The Fed hiked its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2018 and signaled six more hikes this year, spurring a relief rally in stocks.
*****
> The Fed also significantly raised its projections for rate hikes and inflation in 2022, but investors appear to have taken those aggressive changes as proof the central bank was taking the rise in prices seriously.
*****
> “The dot plot shows they’re behind the curve, and we all know they’re behind the curve, and they’re trying to fix it,” said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors. “At least they’re telling the market ‘we’re trying to fix it.’”
*****
> Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, said on “Closing Bell: Overtime” that he expected markets to rally between now and the next Fed meeting in May after selling off sharply to start the year. He pointed to recent high readings on the Cboe Volatility Index, often called Wall Street’s fear gauge, as a sign that the selling had gone far enough, at least in the near term.
*****
> “When the VIX gets above 35, I don’t care how bad the tape looks, I don’t care how bad the geopolitics look, you’re supposed to get more bullish, not more bearish. And you get an oversold bounce,” Gundlach said.
*****
> On Wednesday, the Dow rose 518.76 points, or 1.55%, for its first three-day winning streak in more than a month. It was also the Dow’s second straight day gaining more than 500 points. The S&P 500 gained 2.24%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.77%.

US stocks pared earlier gains to decline steeply in the last hour of trading as market participants digested fresh inflation data, which showed prices in March accelerated to a fresh, forty-year high. Meanwhile, Treasury yields slightly retreated, but the benchmark 10-year yield remained above 2.7%, the highest level since January 2019.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 8.5% in March compared to the same month last year, according to the latest report released Tuesday. The figure marks the fastest rise since December 1981 and follows a 7.9% annual increase in February. Heading into the report, consensus economists were looking for an 8.4% jump for March, according to Bloomberg data.

Excluding food and energy, so-called core CPI increased 6.5% on a 12-month basis, in line with the expectation. However, there were signs that core inflation appeared to be ebbing, as it rose just 0.3% for the month, less than the 0.5% estimate. That in turn sparked some hope that inflation overall was easing and that March might represent the peak.

Some of the biggest contributors to the latest increase in inflation were food, shelter and gasoline, according to the BLS. In fact, the index tracking gas prices surged to rise 18.3% month-on-month in March, comprising more than half of the total monthly increase in CPI. In February, gasoline had posted a 6.6% monthly increase.

Shelter prices rose 0.5% month-on-month in March and by 5.0% over last year, representing the biggest annual rise since May 1991. Airline fares also soared by 10.7% on a monthly basis and by nearly 24% over last year, as rising fuel costs and increased demand for travel pushed ticket prices still higher.

CPI prices accelerated on an annual basis for seven consecutive months now amid supply and demand constraints, especially in labor — with job openings still far outpacing new hires — and a spike in commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Many of these costs have been passed on continuously to the consumer.

With inflation at forty-year highs, members of the Federal Reserve have intensified their hawkish rhetoric, meaning a 50 basis point hike in the next meeting is almost guaranteed. Last week, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said that bringing down inflation was ""our most important task,"" while San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that high inflation was ""as harmful as not having a job.""

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's March meeting minutes suggested that ""many participants ... would have preferred a 50 basis point increase"" in benchmark interest rates, with the larger-than-typical rate hike serving as an aggressive move toward raising borrowing costs and bringing down demand. The Federal Reserve is set to convene for a policy-setting meeting May 3 and 4.

1748,"S&P 500 ""Stock Picking"" Thoughts",,"The S&P 500 is a collection of ""the 500 largest US companies by market cap"". I'll get into why there's quotes there later.

It is common knowledge among investors that the S&P 500 index beats out active investors who ""pick stocks."" For a lot of investors, the S&P 500 is commonly referred to as ""the market"" and is often the benchmark to compare other strategies. After all, it looks well diversified because it holds lots of companies from many different sectors.

The S&P 500 is known as a passive investment. There isn't any managers actively ""picking stocks"", and various implementations (VOO, SPY, etc.) have very little fees.

I do however have a problem with the definition that it is a passive investment. What many may not know is that the stocks within the S&P 500 are actually chosen by a committee. This committee has various requirements for a stock to be included, including fundamentals such as revenues. However, investors are not paying for this, as the committee is a separate entity from the ETFs.

It may also be surprising to some that Apple makes up almost 7% of VOO. I would guarantee that most passive investors would disapprove of having that much of your portfolio into one stock. Different S&P 500 ETFs may have different allocations.

What are your thoughts? Why do we discredit ""stock picking"", but are fine with supposedly ""passive"" ETFs? Why is this committee's fundamental analysis blindly accepted as ""correct"" over other strategies?

Let me know what your thoughts are, and where I get things wrong. I enjoy understanding the nuances of different investment strategies.",tyjdz6,13,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tyjdz6/sp_500_stock_picking_thoughts/

Stocks fell on Wednesday following the release of the Fed’s meeting minutes, which suggested that more members of the Central Bank were open to moving aggressively to raise interest rates to fight the fastest pace in roughly forty years. In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to top 2.6%, marking its highest level since May 2019, while the price of oil declined, falling -4.5% to below $100 a barrel.

Developments on Russia's war in Ukraine and the Western response remained in focus Wednesday as the U.S., European Union and the Group of Seven (G7) readied another round of sanctions against Russia. The U.S. and allies are expected to add additional penalties to more Russian government officials and family members, and Russian-owned enterprises and financial institutions.

In the US, new hawkish commentary by Fed officials sent stocks sharply lower and the Treasury yields spiking. The Fed’s meeting minutes showed officials want to start reducing their balance sheet by around $95 billion a month, a process known as quantitative tightening (QT). The opposite of quantitative easing, QT is a contractionary policy meant to decrease the amount of liquidity within the economy. 

The minutes said, “Notwithstanding uncertainties associated with geopolitical developments, many central banks continued to signal intentions to move ahead with reducing policy accommodation to address elevated inflation.”

Officials “generally agreed” that $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) would be allowed to roll off, phased in over three months and likely starting in May. That total would be about double the rate of the last effort, from 2017-19, and represent part of a historic switch from ultra-accommodative monetary policy of the last two years. 

The minutes said, “In their discussion, all participants agreed that elevated inflation and tight labor market conditions warranted commencement of balance sheet runoff at a coming meeting, with a faster pace of decline in securities holdings than over the 2017–19 period.”

The minutes said, “Many participants noted that one or more 50 basis point increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meetings, particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified.” 

Speaking of the path forward, the minutes revised expectations for the interest rate sharply higher. The minutes said members now expect “the federal funds rate would increase around 170 basis points through year-end, about 70 basis points more than had been priced in at the time of the January meeting. Similarly, the median projection of the target range for the federal funds rate in the Open Market Desk’s most recent surveys of primary dealers and market participants showed an increase of 150 basis points this year.”

Read the entire meeting minutes here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20220316.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20220316.pdf)

In addition to the balance sheet talk, officials also discussed the pace of interest rate hikes ahead, with members leaning toward more aggressive moves. The minutes heavily pointed to a rate hike of 50 basis points (0.50%).  In fact, there was considerable sentiment to go higher in last month’s increase but uncertainty over the war in Ukraine deterred some officials from going with a 50 basis point move in March.

The meeting minutes reaffirmed other, more recent remarks from monetary policymakers. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said Tuesday that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was [""prepared to take stronger action""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brainard-fed-prepared-to-take-stronger-action-on-inflation-140504789.html) should already elevated indicators of inflation rates and expectations warrant such moves.

In addition, [San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the Financial Times on Tuesday](https://www.ft.com/content/94f23e69-33d4-4688-b5b0-c996fa0d77f1) that the case for a 50 basis-point interest rate hike — or a hike double the size of the central bank's typical per-meeting increase — ""has grown.""

With inflation rates in the U.S. still holding at around 40-year highs and forcing the Fed's hand in aggressively tightening financial conditions, some on Wall Street have downgraded their expectations for U.S. and global growth. Deutsche Bank economists said Tuesday they expected the U.S. to tip into a recession at the end of next year as the Fed rapidly hikes rates to address high prices.

Deutsche Bank economists David Folkerts-Landau and Peter Hooper said, “We now expect the U.S. economy to be in outright recession by late next year, and the \[Euro area\] in a growth recession in 2024 with unemployment edging up. Our baseline view is that these developments will spill over to damp growth in much of the rest of the world and at the same time help to bring inflation back toward mandated levels, diminishing the risk of greater disruptions further down the road.""

Still, the economists noted their call for a recession next year ""is currently way out of consensus"" — and indeed, many on Wall Street still see a slowdown, but not necessarily a period of negative growth in the near-term domestically.

Economists at Wells Fargo said in response, “We're not thinking that the Fed is going to push the economy into recession. I think most are not expecting that. But we are expecting a kind of a slowdown in economic growth from what we had expected previously, but still around average economic growth here in the U.S.""

In other news, Chinese authorities on Tuesday extended a lockdown in Shanghai to cover all 26 million people living in the city, despite growing anger over quarantine rules in the city, where latest results show only 268 symptomatic daily COVID-19 cases. The port of Shanghai is the largest port in the world, such a move is likely to further disrupt already snagged supply chains.

* U.S. mortgage applications dropped for a fourth consecutive week into the beginning of April, with fast-rising mortgage rates deterring homeowners from refinancing and new buyers from coming into the market. The Mortgage Bankers Associations' weekly index showed mortgage applications fell 6.3% week-on-week during the period ending April 1. This came following a 6.8% drop during the prior week.

* Today, at the Team22 user conference, Atlassian announced the launch of Compass, a developer portal designed to enable developers to collaborate on security, compliance and projects in a single location. 
* U.S. stock buybacks appear to be hitting new records as companies head into quarterly earnings season, even as some investors worry about the growing threat of inflation, a potential recession and stagnant share prices. New repurchase announcements by U.S. companies reached over $300 billion in the first quarter

CARACAS/HOUSTON, March 31 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state-run energy firm PDVSA is in talks to buy and lease several oil tankers amid a possible expansion in exports, according to three sources and a document seen by Reuters, a sign the country expects U.S. sanctions on its petroleum sector to be eased.

Executives from PDVSA's maritime arm, PDV Marina, and the company's Trade and Supply division recently met with several firms offering tankers. All were willing to take Venezuelan crude or refined products as payment for the vessels, according to the document and sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In one of the proposals seen by Reuters, a company whose name was redacted from the document, offered five Aframax tankers, each with the capacity to transport up to 700,000 barrels of oil, under a lease contract with an option to buy them.

It required PDVSA to pay between $22,500 to $35,000 per day for up to 12 months to lease each vessel under a time-charter contract. Those ships would progressively be replaced by new ones after the first year with payment for the new tankers through four million barrels of Venezuelan fuel oil valued at $300 million, according to the proposal.",ttdnqv,15,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ttdnqv/exclusive_venezuelas_pdvsa_seeks_oil_tankers_in/

I'm trying to understand why the market currently favors Apple over Microsoft.

Right now, Apple (176) is only slightly below its all time high (182.9). While Microsoft (312) is quite below its ath (349.67).

Considering all current supply chain issues, inflation and major economies experiencing stagnation in terms of growth, wouldn't Microsoft have a much better future than apple?

Microsoft mainly addresses the B2B market and a chunk of its revenues come from subscriptions. It's hard to imagine that companies would simply stop using Microsoft products and switch to something else.

On the other hand, Apple is more susceptible to inflation and supply chain issues and there is no real need to buy apple products during economic downturns.

1761,Rising Interest Rates And The Coming DeFi Implosion,,"It's quite well known that crypto has been propped up by things like stable coins and DeFi; both things meant to keep people HODL-ing so that outflows are kept to a minimum. This helps keep coin values artificially high by keeping fund flows stable.

This is a lot easier to do when credit is loose and the cost of debt is very cheap. However, we have now entered a time where interest rates are expected to rise and central banks are looking to tighten the money supply.

A big part of the DeFi ""boom"" has been speculators trading in their real currency (Dollars, Euros, Yen, RMB, etc.) into coins (BTC, ETH, DOGE, etc.). Then when they want to exit one of those coin speculations, they trade their coin into something that is supposed to represent a store of value; stable coins. The money stays in the system because it is converted from one crypto to another; rather than a real currency.

Regardless of whether a crypto speculation is a stable coin or not stable coin (e.g. - BTC), people can ""stake"" it. The idea of ""staking"" is that you lend your coin to another party for a period of time for a set return. This return is oftentimes a multiple of the underlying coin (BTC, ETH, Tether, etc.) but is sometimes converted back into a real currency (Dollars, Euros, etc.) before paying off the ""interest"" on that contract. 

We could get into more depth about specifics and intricacies of these agreements and speculations, but that isn't really the premise of this post. Nor is it material to the issue at hand. Rates are about to rise, liquidity is going to be removed, and there will be significant pressure on DeFi / crypto returns.

Everyone saw that mortgage interest rates rose about a half a percent last week after the Fed recently announced that they would be increasing rates. This is a substantial move in rates and foreshadows the coming risks for crypto.

This is because as rates rise, you'll see more and more people (institutions) move from risky cryptos to safer investment vehicles like treasuries and other bond type investments. From their perspective the incremental return vs the risk becomes less and less compelling as interest rates rise.

As they move their money from DeFi contracts to safer investments, the price of cryptos will fall as money leaves the system. As the price of cryptos fall, the demand for margin debt from DeFi will fall as well. This decreased demand will cause the ""interest rates"" that they pay on these DeFi contracts to fall as well. So a person who used to get ""6% annualized"" on their BTC, will now get something closer to 5%. And combined with the fact that cryptos will fall in price while treasuries are paying more in interest, we'll see this momentum only grow as rates continue to rise. (One thing to think about is whether you believe governments will bail out coins that want to operate outside the control of governments. I say they won't, but crazier things have happened.)

Obviously, there could be more to say about this and I'm sure I'll get a lot of posts debating these observations. Some will say that I don't understand everything there is to know about the crypto world; which is true. Some will disagree with my assumptions; and to me that is probably more reasonable. 

But I will say that not describing everything about what is going on in crypto doesn't make the observation incorrect. Because, in the final analysis, there are only a couple of things that matter with these Ponzi's. Liquidity, leverage, the cost of debt, and a Peter Pan level belief.

Please share your thoughts.

1762,"I don’t understand call options no matter how many videos I watch, I don’t know how to calculate profit.",,"Does anyone have a video or book that can explain it to me like I’m 5?  I just don’t understand how to calculate profit and every video I watch makes it so confusing.  I don’t understand how to find the premium, (I use Webull), is the “last” the premium? Do I simply need to multiply the premium by 100, and then add the premium to the strike price? And then would any price that goes above that number be my profit? Or is the premium already included in the strike price?

1765,Raising interest rates to actually fight inflation,,"This more a hypothetical question for those smarter than myself. Let’s start with my understanding of how raising interest rates impact inflation:

Right now, my money is sitting in my savings account doing nothing. Goods and services are getting more and more expensive everyday. Rather than letting inflation eat away at my money, I decide to spend as much as I reasonably can. For example, cars are getting more and more pricey. Might as well buy one now before they’re even more expensive next year. Now let’s say everyone in my area picks up that mindset. Everyone wants to buy a cat. Now the demand is much stronger than the supply, and prices of cars increase not only because of inflation, but because of demand. This is a sort of inflation spiral. 

Now let’s translate this to the business owner. My restaurant buys wine every week to sell to patrons with their meals. Every week wine goes up 3%. Any extra cash I have is not going into the bank, it’s going towards stocking up as much wine as I possibly can. All other restaurants do this and supply cannot match demand and we have runaway inflation. 

How can the Fed fight this? Make it so that your money sitting in savings isn’t getting destroyed by inflation. How would they do that? Raise interest rates. Here’s my question… how is raising interest rates 0.25% going to do ANYTHING AT ALL?!! Wouldn’t interest rates have to rise to the rate of inflation (or close enough)?? So anywhere from 7-15 percent depending on who you ask? I know things aren’t this simple but I’m just curious how anyone thinks small rate hikes will do anything. The house of cards is pretty easy to predict if/when rates explode. Most people believe we’re in a bubble now. If you had the choice between 7% savings rates and rolling the dice on the SP500 index which would you choose? I feel like we are going to have to drink our inflation medicine (big rate hikes) to avoid major economic collapse, which will be the catalyst for a large market adjustment in stocks/real estate.

1768,Walmart hires PayPal executive as its chief financial officer,Company News,"Walmart said late Tuesday it named John Rainey as its chief financial officer. Rainey currently holds the same position at PayPal Holdings, but his move isn’t the red flag analysts are watching ahead of the payment-processing company’s earnings.

Rainey steps into his new role on June 6. PayPal (ticker: PYPL) said Rainey will remain with it until late May to make possible an orderly transition. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, senior vice president for corporate finance and investor relations, will serve as interim CFO while PayPal looks for a permanent successor.

“I am leaving knowing PayPal is well positioned for the future. Gabrielle Rabinovitch is an extremely well-respected and accomplished colleague, and she has my full confidence to assume the CFO role as the Board conducts its search,” Rainey said in a news release on Tuesday.

The payment-processing company’s first-quarter 2022 revenue and earnings face difficult comparisons against their year-ago pandemic-driven e-commerce peak. But analysts aren’t as concerned about Rainey’s exit as they are about the company’s guidance, or lack thereof since reporting fourth-quarter 2021 earnings back in February.

PayPal said that it expects to earn between $4.60 and $4.75 a share in fiscal 2022. Analysts expect $4.64, according to FactSet.

*****
> Stock futures slipped in early morning trading Tuesday as traders continue to assess the bond market’s warning signals and the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia war.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 60 points lower, or 0.18%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down more than 0.1% each.
*****
> Treasury yields rose broadly Tuesday, but rates on some shorter-term bonds continued to trade above their longer-dated counterparts. The 5-year yield climbed to 2.6%, while the 30-year rate traded around 2.525%. However, the key part of the yield curve briefly uninverted Tuesday, with the 2-year yield trading marginally below its 10-year counterpart.
*****
> These so-called yield curve inversions have historically preceded recessions, so they are closely watched by investors.
*****
> Investors also kept an eye on Europe, as the war between Ukraine and Russia dragged on. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pledged to pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces, noting that more than 300 people were killed and tortured in a suburb near the capital of Kyiv. (Click here for the latest.)
*****
> “Markets have been resilient given the war in Ukraine, continued price pressures, and uncertain global economic outlook, with investors’ ‘buy the dip’ mentality driving equity returns,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research.
*****
> Oil prices, which have shot up since the onset of the war amid concerns over supply disruptions, climbed Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 0.9% at $104.23 per barrel. Brent crude gained 0.7% to $108.30.
*****
> Those moves come after a tech-led rally that saw the Nasdaq Composite rise 1.9% on Monday. Shares of Twitter surged 27% for its best day ever after Elon Musk disclosed a 9.2% passive stake in the social media company. On Tuesday, the stock was up another 1.8%.
*****
> The blue-chip Dow rose about 100 points to begin the trading week, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.8%, both posting their second straight day of gains.
*****
> “In the near-term, we believe indiscriminate selling has created attractive entry points, particularly into some high-growth-potential stocks,” Tony DeSpirito, CIO of U.S. fundamental equities at BlackRock, said in a note.
*****
> The new quarter has kicked off after the major averages finished their worst quarter in two years. Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve meeting minutes Wednesday for further clues on the central bank’s rate-hike path. Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season is set to begin next week.

1781,Shorting and Options,Advice,"This past week I have watched two different documentaries on the GameStop (GME) phenomenon of January 2021ish. Watching the doc Gaming Wall Street, the topic of ""naked short selling"" came up and spurred on some thoughts, which I would like to share. From my knowledge, GME had a short interest of 130%+, however, let's say the shorts had only borrowed 100% of the outstanding shares to short sell. My underlying question is, how then would option traders be able to sell calls or buy puts,  if the underlying shares would have been borrowed for short selling purposes?",tvrx3o,12,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tvrx3o/shorting_and_options/

How do I analyze a stock to see if it’s a good buy or if i should wait? It’s especially confusing to me right now with inflation and the Ukraine war which i think has majorly affected our stock market.  

Here is a list of stocks that i’m looking to potentially invest in:


FB/Meta: Seem to be at a massive discount right now, i know earnings is coming up soon for them.  They seem like a great mid to long term buy


AAPL: It’s apple, can you ever go wrong??? But they definitely don’t seem like a discount right now, still a buy?


Wayfair: Seem to be at a huge discount right now, but i haven’t kept up with them as a company recently.

1788,If your going to select an advisor….,Advice Request,"Personally i recommend that everyone gets financially educated and learns how to do basic investing.  Even if you decide to select an advisor instead investing your self this will help you manage them.  

In my experience many advisors are simply sales people who are going to push you into a managed product then move on. ***this assumes you have >1-2 million in investable assets***. 

Once you start getting to higher Investable asset levels there are some things like IPOs and tax advice that you can get that are very useful as well as unique investment products.  

If your going to select an advisor here are some things to ask:

1. Google their broker U4.  Here is the link: https://brokercheck.finra.org/ 

This is online and simple to find. This shows all their customer complaints and issues. Obvi avoid anyone with complaints

2.  Understand what their client asset tiers are.  Advisors get compensated based on Assets they manage.  They literally are told to focus on higher value clients! 

2.1. Related to point 2. Smaller brokerage firms tend to less good advanced products for high asset clients like IPO access. However they also don’t push advisors to focus only on higher asset clients as much.  If you have more assets then a larger firm maybe a better choice.   

3. Ask about what types of products do they normally put clients into.  Ask them their opinion on ETFs (typically they want to avoid ETFs unless in a managed account)

4. Ask them how often you will be talking with them

5.  Ask how their advice will be different than simply putting money into a target date fund

6. Ask how they get compensated.  Ask on every product they want to put you in what your costs are

7.  Ask to see what your financial report and website will look like

8.  Ask them how often you will be meeting them.  

9.  Try to understand their approach to the markets.  Are they aggressive? Conservative?  Obviously you want to match your goals vs their approach 

10.   Do they come across as salesy and pushy? Are they cocky? Then avoid

In general. If it’s not working out don’t feel weird about finding a new advisor and moving on. It’s YOUR MONEY. Protect it!!!",tpns5q,13,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tpns5q/if_your_going_to_select_an_advisor/

1792,I need some help on when to cut losses,Advice Request,"So first I will give you some info on my situation: 

I started investing 1,5 years ago and like many others I made a few mistakes and jumped on a few hyped stocks (including BABA, NIO and TSM).

* BABA: -46,5% (-1.150€)
* NIO: -53,4% (-662€)
* TSM: -9,3% (-100€)
* 1810: -46% (148€)

 I also am down with a few ETF I bought:

* RIZF: -8% (-424€) Sustainable Food ETF
* XMLH: -12,2% (-1.170€) Healthcare ETF
* ESPO: -3,3% (-380€) Van Eck Video Games
* IS3N: -2,8% (-470€) MSCI EM

I definitely don't want to invest in the above mentioned stocks in the long run. I just thought that I could wait it out and sell as soon as I woukd be in the black figures again. But right now I am not that sure about it anymore.

With the XMLH and ESPO i feel more confident investing long term and would also like to keep them even if the XMLH looks pretty bad atm. I am pretty sure I want to get rid of the Rize ETF and for the case of IS3N I am completely indecisive. Originally I wanted the emerging market having a much higher share in my portfolio but right now I think I don't feel very comfortable with that. 

So like I mentioned in the question above I just don't know how to make the decision on when to cut losses. There might be a time when the stocks are not that much down but I feel waiting to long might also be wrong, especially because I could invest the money also in a better stock/ETF.",tnkifn,14,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tnkifn/i_need_some_help_on_when_to_cut_losses/

1795,Trouble understanding stock market basics,Advice Request,"So in theory, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1mv6vo/comment/ccd0hbe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is WHY someone would buy shares of a company. Now, upon reading up more, I found out that dividend isn't even THAT important to companies or investors anymore. So here is my question: a company goes public, why does anyone even buy its shares then? Like people buying shares only translates into more money for them if more people are willing to buy that share. But unless at some point the shareholder gets money from the company, would he only be buying a share only assuming more people would want to buy it in the future? 


I also read that the value of a share depends on its value perceived by the people (shareholders). So theoretically, if all shareholders of x company stop trading it's shares, will its value ever fall or rise? If yes, then how.

So how about buying up real estate in currently poor (but quickly becoming rich) countries instead? The selected country should be peaceful, open to the free market, and is getting more loans or financial packages from richer countries. You can choose either houses in big cities (safer, more in-the-money), or in some suburban areas that can be bought for dirt cheap then hope it'll evolve into a city later.

I don't understand why Blackrocks aren't doing this (or do they?). Buying real estate from poor countries getting financial packages from US/Japan/EU/etc practically means they get free money from the governments. I don't know much about finance so please explain how this plan might go wrong.

1808,US mortgage market basics,,"When a ‘normal’ residential borrower applies for a home loan in the US, what are the ‘normal’ types of product available to them? 

Normally in the UK, borrowers apply for a fixed rate < 5 years, expecting the borrower will switch onto a comparable fixed rate < 5 years (10 years would be very unusually long period to fix for), or a tracker tied within a % or two of the Bank of England base rate (the primary policy tool for setting interest rate policy in the UK). If the borrower isn’t on such terms, they’ll be charged the lender Standard Variable Rate - considerably higher than fixed or tracker rates, but allowing freedom to switch onto a better rate subject to affordability assessment

How does the US model tend to operate? I’ve come to understand it’s more long-term (20+yr) fixes, but posts I’ve seen recently seem to suggest that such fixed rates are affected by FED rate policy. Is that right, or have I missed something?

1812,Honest company analysis and valuation - Respectfully disagreeing with Jeremy ($HNST),,"Honest company is one of the companies that had terrible share price performance. Since its IPO back in May 2021, the share price is down almost 75%.

Jeremy from Financial Education covered it in a couple of his videos and I decided to take a dive deep at it myself. There's one topic that I'd like to mention before I start with the analysis and valuation.

As humans, we should be able to respectfully disagree and that is okay. There are plenty of negative and hateful comments and that doesn't add value to anyone. When valuing companies, everybody makes assumptions about the future regardless of the approach that is used. Nobody knows what the future brings and we're all going to be wrong with our assumptions. The goal is to be less wrong than the market.

**What is Honest company?**

Honest is a company that formulates, designs, and sells clean products with a focus on sustainability and thoughtful design.

They're reporting three different segments and each one has a different purpose:

1. Diaper and wipes - Although the products are self-explanatory, this is the segment that is used as a customer acquisition tool. It might sound strange, but here's my rationale. When most people go out to buy shoes or clothes, most of us have some sort of a relationship built with certain brands (as well as opinions about brands that are not as good). For a new start-up shoe company to grab our attention, is a difficult task. However, new parents do not have built a relationship with diaper-related brands, so Honest has an almost equal chance to grab the attention of all other brands in this segment. This segment accounts for 63% of all revenue (historical growth was 16% in 2020 and 7% in 2021).
2. Skin and personal care - This is the second segment and the success of the company depends on it. It depends on the new products that are introduced, the acceptance by the customers, and the shelf space that they get in the stores. This segment accounted for 32% of all revenue (historical growth was 36% in 2020 and 28% in 2021).
3. Household & Wellness - The last segment is not their core business, it is related mainly to the sale of sanitizing wipes, hand sanitizers, and disinfecting spray. As expected, the sales increased significantly during 2020 and declined in 2021. Currently, this segment represents only 5% of the total revenue and is expected to further decline.

**The margins**

Their gross margin is around 35%, which is acceptable for a company in this industry.

Roughly 50% of the sales come through their digital channel, which is not surprising due to the nature of these products. Buying diapers is a relatively simple activity and it doesn't require any examination prior to purchase.

However, the 35% margin is not sufficient to cover their SG&A, Marketing, and R&D expenditures, yet. Its operating margin is -12%, which is not surprising for a young and growing company.

&#x200B;

**Financial position**

The company has a relatively simple balance sheet and one that's small in size. There are two main points to be noted:

1. The cash position as of December 31st is roughly $100m, which is sufficient to sustain losses for the next 3-4 years.
2. The company has no debt apart from capital leases of around $40m.

&#x200B;

**What's next?**

The analysts are forecasting 0% revenue growth in 2022, mainly due to the expected decreased sales of sanitizing products, which is offset by an increase in revenue in their two main segments. That doesn't mean the company is no longer growing. As for 2023,  the expected growth is around 10%.

&#x200B;

**Valuation - key assumptions**

As the valuation is based on certain assumptions, here are mine:

**Revenue growth -** 0% next year, followed by 8% up until year 5, then decrease to the risk-free rate of 2.41%.

**Operating margin** \- negative 8% for next year, improving slowly over time, up to 18% in 8 years from now (close to industry average)

**Discount rate** \- 11% (Based on WACC)

**Outcome** \- The company's fair value is $519m ($5.67/share) - slightly undervalued based on my assumptions.

&#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are wrong?**

Based on my assumption, the company's revenue will grow by 70% in 10 years. However, I could be wrong.

So here are a couple of different scenarios related to the revenue and operating margin 10 years from now.

&#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|16%|18%|20%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|50% ($478m)|$4.5|$5.2|$5.8|
|70% ($543m)|$5.0|$5.7|$6.4|
|200% ($956m)|$7.7|$8.9|$10.1|
|300% ($1.3b)|$9.8|$11.3|$12.8|

Jeremy's assumptions are somewhere between the last two rows, however, he is very optimistic also about the margin (expects a net margin of almost 17%, that's close to a 22% operating margin). In that case, the fair value is close to $12/share today.

Does that mean that he's wrong? Of course not, his assumptions about the future of Honest are different than mine and that's okay. We can disagree respectfully.

1818,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 29, 2022",Recap/Watchlist,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, March 29, 2022**

Stocks kept pushing higher, extending earlier gains amid reports that Russia promised to scale down its military operations around Kyiv and northern Ukraine and a new economic report which showed consumer confidence unexpectedly rise in March despite the fastest pace of inflation in forty years. 

**Markets Today** 

* S&P 500 (SPY): +1.23%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.72%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.98%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.67%

* Nielsen (NLSN): +20.22%
* Dave (DAVE): +25.31%
* Ginkgo Bioworks (DNA): +23.53%

The market spiked higher this morning after Russia reportedly decided to “dramatically” scale back its military operations in the Kyiv area, a top Moscow defense ministry official said following a fresh round of peace talks with Ukrainian counterparts in Istanbul. Alexander Fomin, Russia’s deputy defense minister, said the move was intended to “increase mutual trust” as he announced it in Turkey after face-to-face talks concluded on Tuesday.

But western officials cautioned against taking Moscow’s pledge at face value. “Nothing we have seen so far suggests that Putin and his colleagues are particularly serious about the talks. They are likely just playing for time,” said one.  President Biden said he wouldn't “read anything into Russia’s decision.”

U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly edged up in March, suggesting solid job growth offset Americans’ concerns over decades-high inflation that poses the biggest risk to the economy as we continue recovering from the COVID-induced recession. 

The Conference Board’s index increased to 107.2 from a downwardly revised 105.7 reading in February, which was the lowest in a year, according to the group’s report Tuesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a reading of 107.

The report shows that steady labor market gains have pushed employment back to pre-pandemic levels in some sectors, buoying U.S. households. The economy probably added close to a half-million jobs in March (official report due later this year) as the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%. 

But the short-term outlook among Americans reflects less optimism around what's ahead. The expectations index component of the report dropped to 76.6 from 80.8 in February. Respondents cited inflation — particularly higher gas prices — and the war in Ukraine as the biggest factors weighing on their outlook.

""Consumer confidence continues to be supported by strong employment growth and thus has been holding up remarkably well despite geopolitical uncertainties and expectations for inflation over the next 12 months,"" said Lynn Franco, The Conference Board's senior director of economic indicators.

Meanwhile, oil prices tanked on Monday after Shanghai implemented a lockdown to curb a surge in COVID-19 infections, renewing fears of a slowdown in demand. WTI Crude Oil futures ([CL=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CL=F?p=CL=F&.tsrc=fin-srch)) plunged 9.2% to settle at around $103 per barrel, recording their biggest drop in two weeks.

Later this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the March job report, which will give a clearer picture of the state of the labor market in the US. Labor market tightness is a strong influence on the Fed's decision to begin tightening monetary policy, with historically low levels of unemployment coupled with a record number of job openings suggesting the economy is strong enough to absorb these hikes. The report is likely to show another robust reading with payrolls expected to rise by 490,000, according to Bloomberg economist estimates.

Christopher Rupkey, Chief Economist at FWDBONDS, said “The payroll jobs report could be the biggest one yet in this recovery from the pandemic. “Federal Reserve officials are already chomping at the bit for bigger 50 bps rate hikes at upcoming meetings, and the tightest labor market since the 1960s is like pouring gasoline on the fire were any policy official worth his or her salt is burning with desire to get interest rates up to 2% neutral levels now. 

In other economic news,  is a fresh read on the monthly personal consumption expenditures (PCE) due Thursday. The gauge is another indicator of how quickly prices are increasing across the country. Consensus economists expect the PCE to post a rise of another 0.6% in February, according to Bloomberg data. Core PCE, which is the measure the Fed uses to conduct monetary policy, is also expected to show a 0.3% month-over-month increase to 5.5%.

1819,Some nice breakouts in beaten down growth today,Advice,"The indices look a bit exhausted but there are some beautiful buy signals emerging on some of the beaten down growth names. A few that jump out from my watch list:

1) SOFI - Classic trend reversal shaping up with an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and price pushing through resistance on a strongly bullish candle with increased volume. We could see the highest daily volume today that we've seen in weeks. There is some overhead resistance at the 50 DMA around $11.00, but this is a low risk entry point in my opinion. I started a position in January at $13.17 so I'm looking to add here.

2) DKNG - Very similar pattern to SOFI but today's breakout action is even more bullish. Very large candle making a new high and poking above the 50 DMA.

3) PYPL - I actually added to my position yesterday in anticipation of a breakout because it was showing classic volatility contraction. The stock is now well clear of the 20 DMA for the first time since Sept, 2021 and is on the doorstep of the 50 DMA.",trc3o8,13,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/trc3o8/some_nice_breakouts_in_beaten_down_growth_today/
1820,An inverted yield curve need not cause panic - Financial Times,Industry Discussion,"Sorry I know this is pretty dense, but I think these two articles are worth a read. The [FT article is much shorter](https://archive.ph/mHJhb#selection-2069.0-2094.0) so you can start with that one:

> An alternative interpretation of a potential inversion is that bond markets are on board with the Fed’s strategy and believe that inflation will stabilise in the long term. A far more concerning prospect is a steep rise in long-term yields. This would indicate market belief that high rates will be needed for some time in order to achieve price stability. At the moment, movements in equity markets indicate that many investors remain bullish — the S&P 500 has shown no signs of sustained falls.

> Either way, there is good reason to think that “this time is different”. The predictive powers of inversion have never been truly tested at a time of very large central bank holdings of long-term debt. The Fed not only has to make choices about the level at which to set its main short-term policy rate but also how to manage its own vast stock of Treasuries. At present, Powell is indicating the central bank will first raise short-term rates and only then start selling its longer-dated bonds. An inverted yield curve would make some sense if markets believe the Fed will see this policy through.

> Inverted yield curves may have historically predicted recession, but what inversion has meant in the past does not preclude a different outcome now or in the future. In any case, as all good economists know, an exception is always needed to prove a rule.

Here's another more [technical article from Reuters](https://archive.ph/FkPR0) arguing that U.S. Treasury yield curve divergence sends mixed recession signals.

> But the 2-year/10-year yield curve also has its technical issues, and not everyone is convinced it's telling the true story.
> ""Something like 2s/10s, or 5s/30s, will definitely tell you that we're a lot flatter than we've ever been at the start of a hiking cycle,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

> ""Part of that is just the sheer amount of Treasuries that the Fed bought during their COVID QE (quantitative easing) program."" Analysts said the Fed's QE the last two years has resulted in an undervalued U.S. 10-year yield and could explain away the disparity in the two yield curves.

> Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist, at Evercore ISI in New York cited research which suggests the 10-year yield would be around 3.60% without that stimulus. When the Fed starts shrinking its balance sheet via quantitative tightening, Shipley said the 10-year yield will rise to fair value.

> The U.S. 10-year yield was last at 2.475% after hitting a peak of 2.5% on Friday, the highest since May 2019.

> ""Without QE/balance sheet expansion, the 10-year and 2-year spread would be around 140 basis points, which is hardly threatening and consistent with the 10-year and 3-month spread,"" Shipley said.

> The Evercore analyst thinks the 10-year yield should approach fair value in the first half of 2024, or about 120 basis points higher than the current level.

> The U.S. 2-year yield, on the other hand, is fairly priced and Shipley expects the 2s-10s curve to widen.

> What does it mean for the U.S. economy?

> ""Some of the 2-10 shape is down to the fact this is a far more aggressively priced Fed cycle than usual, the notion of how quickly the Fed will move is very front-loaded,"" said Timothy Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy, at State Street.

> ""I suspect we will get a growth slowdown but will it lead to recession? It may be next year's story. Households will want to see the fuel prices coming down but generally household balance sheets are in pretty good shape.""

1822,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 28th, 2022",News,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 28th, 2022.

# **Stocks could take their cue from oil, inflation and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/stocks-could-take-their-cue-from-oil-inflation-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> With the Federal Reserve’s first rate hike out of the way, market pros are now debating whether the market can continue the upswing it started in the past week.
*****
> March’s employment report is coming up in the week ahead, but developments in Ukraine, the price of oil and an inflation report are likely to steer the market.
*****
> Stocks notched gains for the week, while interest rates ripped higher and oil prices jumped. Energy was the top performing sector, up more than 7%, as West Texas Intermediate crude futures closed nearly 9% higher for the week. The closely-watched 10-year Treasury yield was on a tear, reaching 2.5% Friday, its highest level since May 2019 from 2.14% just a week earlier.
*****
> Traders are also watching the rise interest rates to see if they will stall the market’s gains. The S&P 500 was up nearly 1.8% for the week, ending Friday at 4,543.06.
*****
> “Since the war started, on the ten days that were up, the S&P 500 was up at least 1%,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “I don’t think next week is going to be any different. We’re going to be headline driven, whether it’s economic data, news out of Ukraine or crude oil futures.”
*****
> The market has chopped around but is higher for the month of March so far. The S&P was up nearly 3.9% for the month-to-date on Friday.
*****
> Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, said stock charts look promising for the near term but are less clear longer term.
*****
> “We should take advantage of this short-term momentum. I feel pretty good about it short-term. I mean several weeks,” she said. “We’ve also seen some nice short-term breakouts... names getting above their 50-day moving averages.”
*****
> She said 58% of the S&P 500 companies are now above their 50-day moving averages, a positive sign for momentum. The 50-day is simply the average closing price over the past 50 sessions, and a move above it can signal more upside.
*****
> Stocks like Tesla, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet have all regained their 50-day moving averages, she said. Stockton noted that some high-growth tech names have also done so. She pointed to CLOU, the Global X Cloud Computing ETF.
*****
> As for yields, she said the 10-year looks set to consolidate now that it has touched 2.50%. Her next target is 2.55%. “If we get above 2.55%, the next hurdle is 3.25%,” she said.
*****
> # Jobs and inflation
> There is a busy economic calendar in the week ahead, highlighted by the March jobs report and personal consumption expenditures data.
*****
> Consumer confidence and home price data will be released Tuesday.
*****
> PCE includes an inflation measure that is closely watched by the Fed. Economists expect to see core PCE inflation up by 5.5% year-over-year when it is reported Thursday, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> There is also the ISM manufacturing survey reported Friday. The key nonfarm payrolls report will also run that day.
*****
> Economists expect 460,000 jobs were added in March and the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to the 678,000 nonfarm payrolls added in February and an unemployment rate of 3.8%.
*****
> “I definitely think at this point that inflation data is much more meaningful than employment, in terms of the path of the economy,” said Ben Jeffery, vice president of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. Jobs will still matter, but the Federal Reserve has pivoted to focus more on combating inflation, while the economy is reaching maximum employment.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made that point when he spoke to economists Monday, saying the central bank would be willing to be more aggressive raising interest rates to battle inflation. Stocks initially sold off on his comments, amid fears the Fed could slow the economy or even bring on a recession.
*****
> Since then, stocks moved higher, but interest rates have been galloping higher. The fed funds futures market has been pricing in 50-basis-point rate hikes — or 0.5% — in both May and June.
*****
> ″[Nonfarm payrolls] will matter... I do think it’s probably going to be more a story of just how far the market is willing to press the 50-basis-point rate hike narrative, which is likely to be more pressing next week,” said Jeffery. “The excitement that once surrounded jobs is definitely less so at this point in the cycle.”
*****
> In the bond market, Jeffery said investors will be watching Treasury auctions Monday and Tuesday, when the government issues $151 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes.
*****
> Rising oil prices have been driving inflation expectations higher, and the bond market is closely watching crude prices, as is the stock market. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled up 8.8% for the week, at $113.90 per barrel Friday.
*****
> # Oil heats up
> “It seems like oil north of $100 has some staying power,” BMO’s Jeffery said.
*****
> Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said the pattern between stocks and oil will continue to be important. When oil has spiked recently, stocks have weakened, he said. Meanwhile, when crude falls, stocks have been able to rally,
*****
> “It seems like this week it was a bit more pronounced again when oil prices were rising pretty aggressively,” Arone said. “It’s got this interconnectedness to a few things — sentiment about the Ukraine conflict, how’s that going, inflation and ultimately how hawkish or dovish the Fed is going to be. I think it’s emerged as one of those binary proxies for these other elements in the market.”
*****
> “It’s just a barometer for those other things — the Ukraine conflict, inflation and the Fed,” he said.
*****
> Arone said as investors anticipate some sort of resolution that will end the conflict in Ukraine, but it’s not clear when. “The headlines coming out of Ukraine will continue to cause volatility,” he said. “At the margin, investors are gaining comfort with the likely outcome.”
*****
> Arone said stock market fundamentals are better than some investors expect. When inflation rises, topline revenues can also go higher.
*****
> “Everyone knows multiples have contracted, stocks have gotten cheaper, but one thing that’s gotten lost on investors is top-line revenues have this correlation with inflation,” he said. “Corporate profits and CPI [the consumer price index] are kind of connected. You have multiples contracting but earnings estimates are rising.”
*****
> Arone said stocks are reasonably positioned and investors are getting more comfortable that there will be a favorable resolution to the war.
*****
> “If we can get past the Ukraine conflict and some of the fears about the Fed and inflation, I think the fundamentals are okay,” he said.

> # The Bull Market Turns Two

> The bear market ended two years ago today and the subsequent bull market has clearly been an amazing ride. For some context, it was the fastest bull market to double ever, at just under 18 months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Chart-1.png))**

> Here’s where it ranks against the other bull markets that have doubled. You can see it is currently up 102%, making it the best bull market on its second birthday ever. 2009 was up 95%, coming in second.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-2.png))**

> At the recent peak in early January, the S&P 500 Index was up 114%, making it the seventh bull market to double. The annualized return of 53.4% shows just how explosive this move was off the lows and does imply some type of break could be warranted.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-3.png))**

> Here’s another way to look at this bull market as it starts year three. Previous strong bull markets saw modest gains and really spent much of the third year consolidating the previous big gains.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-4.png))**

> “As this bull market reaches the third year of life, investors need to remember that year three of bull markets tend to be a little tamer, with the larger gains happening in year one and two,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, out of the 11 bull markets since World War II, we found that three of them ended during year three, while the ones that didn’t end saw an average gain of only 5.2%.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, year three of bull markets have returned only 5.2% on average for the S&P 500, versus first year gains of 41.8% and second year gains of 12.8%, while three bull markets outright ended in year three.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-5.png))**

> We expect the bull market to continue, but some bumps in the road are normal. As the bull ages, year three could provide some of those bumps.

> For more on the bull market turning two and what could happen next, please watch the latest LPL Market Signals podcast with Jeff Buchbinder and Ryan Detrick, as they break it all down.

> # 5 Energy Stocks Reached ATHs

> Energy stocks have roared higher since the beginning of 2022, gaining a whopping 38.8% in less than three months (as of yesterday's close). This comes on the back of sharp moves higher in crude, thus implying higher margins and increased bottom line earnings per share. During the pandemic, energy stocks were among the most hurt, as a reduction in travel and economic activity led to a crash in oil markets. Although the YTD gain is certainly substantial, investors that have held energy stocks since mid-2008 are still in the red. The energy sector ETF (XLE) is still 23.0% off of its high price since the turn of the century, which occurred in June of 2014. As you can see from the chart below, XLE has broken its long-term downtrend and is nearing a breakout above 2018 levels. To retest the high of the century, XLE would need to gain another 29.8%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/XLE-since-2000-graph-032522.png))**

> On March 11th of this year, the relative strength reading of XLE vs the S&P 500 (SPY) since 2000 turned positive for the first time since COVID was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The ratio has since turned negative, and the reading is currently -5.0 percentage points. The relative strength had moved continuously lower from its high in 2008 through early 2021, but the recent reversal higher is substantial.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/XLE-vs-SPY-RS-032522.png))**

> Although Energy has been strong as of late, only five of the 63 Energy sector stocks in the S&P 1500 have hit all time highs in 2022 (to be considered, the stock must have been trading for at least five years). The five stocks are ConocoPhillips (COP), Chevron (CVX), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Matador Resources (MTDR) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). Below are the charts of these stocks since the turn of the century. The average stock on this list is up 41.3% on the year as of yesterday's close, which is only slightly greater than the performance of XLE.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/Individual-charts-032522.png))**

> Not all of the increase to bears came from bulls. As shown below, neutral sentiment fell from 30.2% down to 27.8%. That is only the lowest level since the end of February. While bullish and bearish sentiment are both over a full standard deviation away from their historical averages, neutral sentiment is much more inline with its own historical average. Whereas all weeks since the start of the survey has seen neutral sentiment average a reading of 31.4%, this week's reading was only a few percentage points away.

***** 

> # Bulls and Bears Swing Double Digits

> There's nothing like higher prices to cure investor blues, and the last week has been a perfect example of that. AAII's weekly sentiment survey saw a double-digit increase in the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish this week with that reading rising from 22.5% up to 32.8% and matching the highest level of optimism in 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-AAII-Bulls.png))**

> Those gains to bullish sentiment borrowed entirely from bears as the percentage of respondents reporting as pessimistic fell from nearly 50% of respondents down to 35.4%. The 14.4 percentage point decline marked the largest weekly decline in bearish sentiment since July 2010 when the reading had fallen by 19.27 percentage points. More recently, however, there have been a couple of other double-digit drops in bearish sentiment including a 12.3 percentage point decline in the first week of March and an 11.9 percentage point drop in December.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-AAII-Bears.png))**

> Bears continue to outnumber bulls, but the margin has narrowed to the smallest degree since the first week of the year. The bull-bear spread has risen to -2.6 after leaping higher by 24.7 points week over week; the largest one-week increase in the number since October 2019.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Looking at it another way, this week marked the first time since October 2019 that bullish sentiment rose by at least 10 percentage points while bearish sentiment fell by at least 10 percentage points in the same week. In the table below, we show each prior instance of simultaneous double-digit swings in bullish and bearish sentiment without another occurrence in the previous six months. As for how price action has responded to such swings in sentiment, the S&P 500 has generally seen consistently positive performance in the months ahead, but only one week and one-month performance has been significantly stronger on an average or median basis than what has been the norm.

> # Best Performers Since 3/14 Pivot

> Early last week, the US equity market pivoted, gaining 1%+ for four consecutive days between last Tuesday and last Friday (3/15-3/18). Sentiment has shifted amongst the investing community for the time being. For now, it seems that the market may have largely priced in some of the most hawkish Fed tightening scenarios. Remember, we already saw huge drops of 50%, 60%, 70%, even 80%+ in many of the most interest-rate sensitive growth stocks before the Fed even lifted off of 0%. How much further were investors expecting them to go?

> Since the 3/14 pivot, certain members of the S&P 1500 have already gained over 20%, but still remain well off of 52-week highs. Of the top 35 performers since last Monday, the average stock is still 43.4% off of its 52-week highs (median: 47.1%). Although there is much recovery room left for many of these high-flyers, this is a move in the right direction. The top performing stock since the 3/14 close is GameStop (GME), which has moved 58.0% higher on the back of a 30.9% move today. This may imply that investors have increased their risk appetite, or that retail investors viewed the dip as a buying opportunity, which would likely apply to the broader market from a retail perspective. Selectquote (SLQT) and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) rank immediately below GME, gaining 53.7% and 45.9% respectively. Both of these stocks are operating at a loss on the bottom line, which tells us that the risk-on trade has performed strongly over the last week. Other noteworthy names on the list include Tesla (TSLA), Avis Budget (CAR), Etsy (ETSY), NVIDIA (NVDA) and PayPal (PYPL).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/Best-perf-since-31422-032222.png))**

> Breaking this down further, the sectors that help up strongly in the face of a downturn earlier this year have performed the worst since the 3/14 pivot. Utilities and Energy members of the S&P 1500 have only gained 0.6% and 2.6% on average, respectively, since last Monday. On the other hand, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Technology members of the S&P 1500 have gained 7.8%, 8.1% and 10.6% on average, respectively. Based on the data below, the sectors most off their highs have rallied the most aggressively since the pivot, while the sector leaders from pre-3/14 have lagged.

> # Best S&P 500 Stocks Since the COVID Crash Lows

> Two years ago to the day, the S&P 500 put in a low after a 33.9% pullback from the closing high on 2/19/20. While the S&P 500 is once again off its highs, the index sits just over 100% above that 3/23/20, low and 32.7% above the pre-pandemic high. In the table below, we show the current S&P 500 components which have rallied the most since the COVID Crash low as well as how much each stock declined during the crash.

> While it was not a member of the S&P 500 at the time of the COVID crash, being added on 12/21/20, Tesla (TSLA) is currently the S&P 500 member which has risen the most since the broader market low. After being more than cut in half, it has since risen over 1,000%. The next best performers are Devon Energy (DVN) and APA Corp (APA); a couple of Energy sector names that saw even larger declines of 72.8% and 84.86%, respectively from 2/19/20 to 3/23/20. Along since Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), both stocks have risen well over 800% over the past two years. Of the list of the 25 best performers in the S&P 500, the only one that managed to move higher during the COVID Crash was vaccine producer Moderna (MRNA) which had risen 40.43% as the rest of the market collapsed.

> By the time of the 3/23/20 low, the index's worst performers since the pre-pandemic high (2/19/20) had seen monumental declines with many of those stocks dropping over 70%. On the other end of the spectrum, only four stocks had eeked out a gain and only another seven stocks had fallen single-digit percentage points.

> As for what those stocks have done since then, below we have created equal weight indices comprised of the S&P 500 members that are still actively traded that were the 20 best and 20 worst performers from 2/19/20 to 3/23/20. Each basket as well as the S&P 500 are indexed to 100 at the COVID Crash low. As shown, what had at one point been the most beaten-down names, have crushed it over the past two years; hypothetically having turned $100 into $481 having even held up well during the recent bout of weakness for equities. For comparison, the biggest winners in the early days of the pandemic bought at the lows would have only seen $100 turn into $137.64 while the S&P 500 as a whole would have a little more than doubled.

> # Jobless Claims at Lowest Level in Over 50 Years

> Since early December, initial jobless claims have risen and remained above multi-decade lows. That is until this week. Seasonally adjusted claims fell for a second week in a row down to 187K this week. That is the lowest reading since claims came in at 182K all the way back in September 1969.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> While not to take away from the historically strong reading as NSA claims also hit a new low for the pandemic of 181.1K, before seasonal adjustment, jobless claims have not exactly fallen to as significant of a low as the adjusted number. Although that is the lowest level for the current week of the year since 1969, there have been recent periods like the fall of 2018 and 2019 in which claims were even lower. Declines in initial claims have historically been common for the current week of the year, but the next couple of weeks have typically seen claims experience a brief bump before resuming a seasonal downtrend roughly through mid-spring.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

> Continuing claims have fallen even more consistently with week-over-week improvements in 7 of the past 10 weeks. Now at 1.35 million, continuing claims are down to the lowest level since the first week of 1970.

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose Friday morning as the S&P 500 looked to close out its second consecutive positive week.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained about 95 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures added 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures ticked up 0.4%.
*****
> The move comes after a solid session for stocks on Wednesday in which the S&P rose 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.9% and the Dow added 349 points.
*****
> For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up 1.3% and 2.1%, respectively. Both are on track for their second-straight winning week. The Dow is down marginally week to date.
*****

Stocks fell on Wednesday, giving back some of yesterday’s gain, as market participants digested new remarks by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and contemplated the potential that the Fed will take a more aggressive than expected approach to reigning in decades-high inflation. The price of crude oil was on the rise again, with the West Texas Intermediate rising roughly 4% to $114 per barrel. 

**Markets Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.29%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.44%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.36%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.36%

US stocks have see-sawed between gains and losses this week as investors weight recent, hawkish remarks by Jerome Powell. Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics, Powell said the Central was ready to “take necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability”. This implies the Fed is ready to raise the interest rate by 0.50 basis points or more if warranted. In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm)

Last week, the Fed raised the interest rate for the first time since 2018, bringing it up by 0.25% from near-zero levels. Acknowledging that inflation will likely stay higher for longer, policymakers have revised their forecasts higher and now expect six additional hikes (not including the most recent one). Inflation (as measured by core PCE) is expected to be at 4.1% this year, up from a 2.7% projection in December. By 2023, inflation is estimated at 2.6%, up from an earlier forecast of 2.3%. 

Regarding the interest rate, Jim Read, head of credit strategy and thematic research at Deutsche Bank, said “Equities tend to continue their upwards march in the nine months after the Fed begins to tighten, as the strong economy that enabled hikes supports growth. After that, equities become more volatile and are more likely to experience a drawdown. Ten-year Treasury yields start increasing, sending their prices lower, but eventually flatten out and decline as markets put increasing probabilities on the next recession coming. History suggests we should not be worried about near-term impacts.""

In other news, market participants continue to closely monitor developments coming out of Ukraine and the global response to such developments. President Biden is set to travel to Brussell on Wednesday to convene a summit of NATO allies, a meeting that will likely see more sanctions levied against Russia. 

**Highlights**

* U.S. new home sales unexpectedly declined for a back-to-back month in February, underscoring some slowing housing activity and demand as rates moved higher and affordability became further squeezed. New home sales fell 2.0% in February compared to January, [the Commerce Department said Wednesday.](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf) This compared to an increase of 1.1% consensus economists were expecting
* An index tracking weekly mortgage applications dropped 8.1% during the week ended March 18, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said Wednesday. This came after a 1.2% decline during the prior week.
* Toyota Motor and Aurora Innovation have started testing autonomous an autonomous ride-hailing fleet in Texas, with two safety operators and no passengers on board. Toyota's Sienna minivans, retrofitted with Aurora's self-driving system, will be tested on highways and suburban streets in the Dallas-Fort-Worth area, with the operation including trips to the airport.
* Alphabet Inc's Google said on Wednesday that it would allow Spotify to use its own payment system in its Android app as part of a new pilot. Users who have downloaded Spotify from the Google Play Store will be presented with a choice to pay with either Spotify's payment system or with Google Play Billing.
* LG Energy Solution plans to build a battery factory in Arizona to supply to Tesla and other customers, two persons familiar with the matter told Reuters.
* Sales of McDonald’s ‘McPlant’ sandwich, created with Beyond Meat (BYND) are “underperforming franchise sales”, according to analysts at BTIG Research. This does not bode well for BYND stock, which is already very beaten down.
* Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc. announced it will go public in the United States by merging with blank-check firm Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV Inc. in a deal valued at roughly $1.25 billion.

1828,Do inverse bond ETFs reveal a bond market inefficiency?,,"The 10 year US Treasury yielded 1.52% on Dec 31 2021 and yields 2.14% now, for a rise of 0.62%.  This year the Fed is expected to raise interest rates 1.75%, which is very low compared to inflation currently over 7%.  Let's say inflation cools - it will still be 3-5%, so the Fed needs to keep acting in 2022-2023.

If the Fed simply kept on track, yields would need to push 1% higher.  As that happens, inverse bond ETFs make significant gains.  In my view, the chance of this happening is so high, the bond market should reflect it - but there's only 0.62% worth of higher yields in the 10 year treasuries.

In this scenario, I would expect I'm missing something rather than the market not being efficient.  What risks are there to inverse bond ETFs that I've missed?",tk4oan,10,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tk4oan/do_inverse_bond_etfs_reveal_a_bond_market/

1835,The bear case against F,Company Analysis,"Ok I don’t have a short position but I always consider the bear case. It’s actually kind of fun to pick apart your own thesis.

So, here’s my thoughts about Ford and it’s pivot into EV.


The electric F150 is very cool. Who doesn’t like that? Give it a few years and will be the best selling pickup, no surprises there.

Now you might think that’s great! But think about it. Who’s customers would Ford be taking by having the best selling Pickup? 
Their own…

Yea they can probably steal some customers from other pickup manufacturers (even though they are also going EV mind you), but the main bulk of their customers is going to be their own existing customers who bought the gas version of the F150.
Now I’m not American and I don’t own a pickup, but there is probably a high level of fanboying about pickups as well. 


Ford isn’t challenging the EV market with the F150, it’s challenging the same old pickup market that it’s challenged for how many years now? 
And that brings me to another point, how long has Ford been around, 100 years or something? You’d get good odds at the bookies that F is gonna grow substantially any time soon.

But what about electric cars I hear you say!
Well I hear that, but all I see is much expensive retooling.
Startup EV companies have an advantage there, they don’t need to retool and retrain, they are fresh off the bat.

And then there is the dealership thing..


TDLR:
F looks like a value trap to me or worse, it has an ok dividend though if that’s your thing.

1836,Tax basis and Yahoo's adjusted price,,"I need to calculate a stock basis for some inherited stock, sold several years after date of death.  I know that the basis in this case is FMV calculated as of date of death, usually using the average of open and closing prices.  This is easy to get from Yahoo's historical data.

But what threw me is that Yahoo also has an adjusted close, factoring in dividends and splits.  I've read Yahoo's explanation about the adjusted basis, but I want confirmation that my analysis is correct. 

From a tax perspective, only a split affects the calculation.  A 2 for 1 split means halving the original basis.  A dividend doesn't, because dividend is taxed when received.  

What this suggests to me is that Yahoo's adjusted close isn't useful for computing the tax basis.  You still need to look for splits (fortunately none in my case), but you can go ahead and use the actual closing price and not Yahoo's adjusted closing price for computing the tax basis?

Agree?  If so, what is the value of the adjusted close?  I assume it has some meaning for investment analysis, but don't know what it is.

**How to survive a bear market?**

1. **If you're buying shares**, dollar cost averaging will help reduce the pain if the stock keeps dropping.
2. **Diversify your holdings**. Is your entire portfolio in growth tech? Look into defensive stocks, dividend yielding cyclicals.
3. **Look into sectors that perform well in recessions**. Consumer staples, energy and utilities. Financial sector can benefit the six interest rate hikes that are on the horizon.
4. **Focus on the long-term**. Are you investing for retirement and it's still 20-30 years away? In the long run, the bull markets will make up for the bears, as long as you don't panic and run.
5. **Invest with defined outcome option strategies** with high probability of winning and longer dated expirations (12-18 months). Sure it may not be as exciting as YOLOing into a single put, but a put spread will help you preserve your hard won capital and help it grow.

Net income for the six biggest U.S. banks is forecast to be down about 35% from last year, with a sharp deceleration in activity seen during March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Bank reports will be watched closely on the costs side, particularly with labor, technology and acquisition expenses rising. UBS thinks there could be a surprise to the upside for the sector with guidance likely to highlight that the benefits of higher rates and better than anticipated loan growth could offset higher credit cost provisions and weaker equity markets.

US equities finished mixed Friday to close out a negative week as market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minutes and look forward to the March consumer price index (CPI), which will provide further insight into the pace of inflation. 

As a reminder, the previous consumer price index (CPI), which showed prices rose an average of 7.9% year-over-year, did not account for the spike in oil and other commodities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As a result, expect CPI to come in even higher next week.

With the fastest pace of inflation in forty years, commentary from Federal Reserve officials remains in focus. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he wants the Fed to get to between 3% and 3.25% on the funds rate in the second half of this year, implying more aggressive, front-loaded interest rate hikes in the near-term. Bullard was the only dissenter in the Fed's March meeting, calling for a larger 50 basis point interest rate hike versus the 25 basis point hike that ultimately occurred.

While Bullard has consistently been the most hawkish member of the Fed, there are signs other officials are also warming up to the idea of a 0.50 basis point hike in the next meeting. 

Fed Governor Lael Brainard said that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was [""prepared to take stronger action,""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brainard-fed-prepared-to-take-stronger-action-on-inflation-140504789.html) should inflation readings remain elevated and warrant such moves. And in the Fed's meeting minutes released Wednesday afternoon, the central bank revealed that ""many participants ... would have preferred a 50 basis point increase"" in rates, and also suggested the Fed was gearing up to soon announce the start of its balance-sheet runoff process.

However, other members of the Fed continue to offer a more dovish approach to raising rates. [Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-bostic-evans-back-rate-193909071.html)said it would be ""appropriate"" to move the benchmark interest rate ""closer to a neutral position,"" suggesting a somewhat less hasty series of interest rate hikes. Meanwhile, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans suggested the Fed would be able to ""get to neutral, look around, and find that we're not necessarily that far from where we need to go.""

Kevin Nicholson, chief investment officer of global fixed income in Riverfront Investment Group, said “The market actually had to digest a lot of information — a lot of hawkish information from the Fed over the last couple of days. We had been in a sell-off mode. And I think \[Thursday\] we finally got a chance to take a breather and realize that the equity markets especially have some actual positive things that are going on. We also think that you have support with a strong labor market. ""The economy is in great shape from that perspective.""

Next week, earnings season kicks off, with JP Morgan and other big banks presenting their Q1 2022 earning reports. This will help elucidate how the economy has performed during a very tough quarter.

The Fed’s meeting minutes showed officials want to start reducing their balance sheet by around $95 billion a month, a process known as quantitative tightening (QT). The opposite of quantitative easing, QT is a contractionary policy meant to decrease the amount of liquidity within the economy. 

The minutes said, “Notwithstanding uncertainties associated with geopolitical developments, many central banks continued to signal intentions to move ahead with reducing policy accommodation to address elevated inflation.”

Officials “generally agreed” that $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) would be allowed to roll off, phased in over three months and likely starting in May. That total would be about double the rate of the last effort, from 2017-19, and represent part of a historic switch from ultra-accommodative monetary policy of the last two years. 

The minutes said, “In their discussion, all participants agreed that elevated inflation and tight labor market conditions warranted commencement of balance sheet runoff at a coming meeting, with a faster pace of decline in securities holdings than over the 2017–19 period.”

The minutes said, “Many participants noted that one or more 50 basis point increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meetings, particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified.” 

Economists at Bank of America, which recently modified its Fed call to include 50 basis point rate hikes in June and July, said in a Wednesday note the newly released minutes show enough evidence to tip the scales towards a double bump increase in May.

In other news, the U.S., European Union and the Group of Seven (G7) readied another round of sanctions against Russia. The U.S. and allies are expected to add additional penalties to more Russian government officials and family members, and Russian-owned enterprises and financial institutions.

Testifying before the House Financial Services committee on Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that Russia’s war in Ukraine will stoke “enormous economic repercussions around the world,” including disruptions to the flow of food and energy.

Yellen also said that Russia should be expelled from the Group of 20 major economies forum, and the U.S. will boycott ""a number of G20 meetings"" if Russian officials participate.

1848,4-6-22 SPY/ Apple Daily TA,ETFs,"  

The coveted FOMC minutes release finally happened. What did we learn? Well not a whole lot new honestly. All we have learned is that clearly JPOW are hawkish and ready to do another 0.5bps hike in May at the next meeting. We also learned that the previously doveish members are now even hawkish. 

SPY had a massive gap down at open today from 451 close all the way to 447.3 at open, which of course left a big gap on the daily chart. We know how SPY does not like to leave gaps too… 

&#x200B;

Intraday despite the massively red pre-market and first big red candle SPY traded within a pretty tight range hovering around 445.5 from 945am to 130pm. We saw some green start to take off right before the minutes dropped. They got a lot of people with the fake out (me included) with running it all the way to 448.5 before they dropped it like its hot to 444.2 immediately after. From there I saw some of the craziest intraday swings in such a short period of time that I have ever seen. 

Spy dropped from 448.5 to a low of 443.47 (-1.1%, $5) rose to a high of 448.93 (+1.23%, $5.5) and then dipped to 445.32 (-0.8%, $3.5) and rose to 448 (+0.6%, $2.7) all within two hours of trading. That kind of volatility has not been seen in quite a long time. And being end of the day those who were brave enough to play 0dte made some incredible gains. I was able to recoup my losses plus 2x daily profit on one 0dte put on the initial -1.1% drop along with a few call plays to hit 6x daily profit in one day. 

&#x200B;

It is not surprising that we traded so close to 445.5 all day as that level is a key support of the Daily 20ema. It looked like when the minutes released we may see an aggressively red day and close below those key supports near the 440 level, however, 445 proved to be too strong to break through today. We also found out that 448 to 449 was major resistance too, as anytime we touched it end of day we immediately rejected down.

With a clear MACD sell and RSI trending downward now, favor to bears short term.

On the daily chart you can see we technically still have about an 89 cent gap from 448.93 to 449.82. Some could argue a gap this small is not important and will not be filled yet. One also may argue since its to the upside the push to close it now is not there as much as a gap below would be. Todays close and post market still have some bearish flavor to it. However, being able to close about the EMAs is fairly bullish. 

Intraday tomorrow and overnight we need to see if 1. The gap will be filled up to 449.82 and 2. If the daily 20ema (447.05), daily 100ema (446.7) and daily 50ema (445.2) is going to hold as support intraday tomorrow with the daily 50ema being the key support. If we were to get a bullish push tomorrow the daily 8ema at 451.37 will now come in to play as possible resistance. Failure for bulls to break and close above that again would be bearish. 

If the bears were to get another true bear day I would suspect they will try to close near the 200ema at 439.82. That being the final support bulls have to hold before we would see 410-420 again. 

&#x200B;

The weekly candle is now coming in fairly bearish after a doji last week would hint to me that we very well could see some red next week also. Key support for bulls to hold would be the weekly 8ema at 444.88 and the weekly 20ema at 446.43. A close back below those would all be confirm a dip next week back near the weekly 50ema of 435.07. 

&#x200B;

The VIX had yet another massive day today from its low of 21.24 to its highest point of 24.78 ranging 16.6% of movement. This is three massive movement days for VIX in a row, yet we have not really seen a massive 2%+/- day for SPY yet. I believe tomorrow or Friday it is coming. 

The VIX key level to watch is 24.5 for the bears and 22 for the bulls. Now that the VIX is back ABOVE the average of 16.5 to 21.5 the bulls are in favor here as its is usually easier for VIX to unwind down with no new news than to go up. 

&#x200B;

Apple is looking similar to SPY on the daily chart with a clear MACD sell, and rsi at 53 trending down. Apple also has a pretty significant gap from 174.42 to 173.63 (0.45%, 0.79) on the daily chart. 

Apple found support today at its daily 20ema which has not ben touched in over two weeks. 

Apple bulls need a green day tomorrow to fill the gap up to a 174.42, however, they will need to break now resistance at the daily 8ema. 

Apple bears will look for a close below the daily 20ema at 170.96. Bears will not need a very red day to accomplish this and their ultimate goal will be to get Apple below the daily 50ema at 168.44(only -2% from todays close) by end of the week. If bears can accomplish this 157 to 165 will be back in play. A close below the daily 100ema of 165.31 (-3.8% from close) while a very tough chore to accomplish in two days, it is not out of possibility for Apple depending how markets react. 

The questions going into tomorrow is now that the markets have the full minutes from FOMC and nothing news wise until April 12th with the next CPI data…. Which I fully expect to be awful and another emergency/ surprise rate hike. With the markets now seeing the true hawkish fed and the new info about the balance sheets/ QT and rate hikes is the markets going to go back into full panic mode like January? Or will the markets too quickly price this in and return to full rally mode? 

I will be looking at tomorrows close and more importantly Fridays close for that clue. We have key supports and resistance that will give us a clue going into next week. 

I will be back on the sever all day tomorrow after taking the morning off for personal errands and I will also have a proper pre market post up around 9am tomorrow on the server for everyone. 

10% challenge-

Today was a pretty good day for me.

I entered some Apple and Spy puts around that time that I held till the first big green candle at 2pm and sold both for -50%. I then was able to grab a nice 80% 0dte play on the way down to recoup those loses + x2 my daily gains goalI had another 2dte -20% put that I played on the first recovery bounce when it faked us out red before ripping green (which is when I entered calls). I then played two different 2dte calls one for 40% and one for 30%. Overall being able to hit 6x my daily profit goal is incredible. I look to go into Thursday and Friday with low risk and being very conservative as I do not want to risk losing all these gains on silly plays.

1849,Fed officials to take cleaver to balance sheet; 'many' back big rate hikes,,"by Howard Schneider and Ann Saphir 

April 6 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials in March ""generally agreed"" to cut up to $95 billion a month from the central bank's asset holdings as another tool in the fight against surging inflation, even as the war in Ukraine tempered the first U.S. interest rate increase.
Minutes of the Fed's March 15-16 meeting showed deepening concern among policymakers that inflation had broadened through the economy, which convinced them to not only raise the target policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point from its near-zero level but also to ""expeditiously"" push it to a ""neutral posture,"" estimated to be around 2.4%.

""Many"" Fed officials said they were prepared to raise rates in half-percentage-point increments in coming policy meetings to try to bring prices under control, even though the rising risks tied to the Ukraine war held them to the standard hike in March, according to the minutes, which were released on Wednesday. read more
But they also moved forward with plans to pull out of key financial markets that have been benefiting from massive Fed support since March of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic prompted the central bank to buy trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS).

After months of debate, policymakers rallied around a plan to as soon as next month reduce the Fed's holdings of Treasury bonds by up to $60 billion per month and its MBS holdings by up to $35 billion per month, with the amounts phased in over three months or slightly longer, the minutes said.
The pace of the planned balance-sheet rundown, which should have the effect of increasing long-term interest rates, is nearly double that of the Fed's ""quantitative tightening"" from 2017 to 2019, and could also include outright sales of MBS down the road, said the minutes.

""All participants agreed that elevated inflation and tight labor market conditions warranted commencement of balance sheet runoff.""

SWOLLEN BALANCE SHEET
The details of the balance sheet program included in the minutes are in line with analysts' expectations, and pave the way for it to be set in motion after the Fed's May 3-4 policy meeting.
The Fed unveiled its bond-buying program in the spring of 2020, swelling its holdings of Treasuries and MBS from $3.8 trillion to $8.5 trillion.

Yields on U.S. Treasury securities ticked higher after the release of the minutes, with the 10-year note yield climbing to 2.6%, while the dollar rose to its highest level since late May against a basket of currencies. Major U.S. stock indexes closed the session sharply lower.
""I don't think there's anything material that would garner a change in sentiment, as opposed to yesterday where there was a real change and I think it really spooked investors,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz and Associates in Toledo, Ohio, referring to comments made by Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday.

Brainard told a Minneapolis Fed conference that she expected a combination of interest rate increases and a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year, with further tightening to follow as needed. read more

*  The Fed is looking to undo its ""quantitative easing""  policies that stimulated the economy during the pandemic as the Fed  accumulated a $9 trillion portfolio. It will do so through ""quantitative  tightening,"" or allowing the portfolio to shrink by not replacing  securities that mature. 
*  Participants ""generally agreed"" on allowing up to $60 billion of  Treasury securities and $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities to run  off each month. 
*  Phasing in the tightening program over three months, ""or modestly  longer"" if market conditions warrant. That process could begin following  a meeting that concludes May 4.

1851,"XOM, Q1 performance hit a new high in 7 years, does it support the stock price to rise again?",,"Exxon Mobil Corp said on Monday that its first-quarter results could hit a seven-year high, with operating profit of $9.3 billion in the oil and gas extraction business alone.

&#x200B;

Operating profit at Exxon's oil and gas business could rise as much as $2.7 billion from $6.6 billion in the previous quarter, according to data for the quarter ended March 31.

&#x200B;

Exxon has not hedged or locked in oil sales through hedging, and its performance has generally matched changes in energy prices. Oil prices rose 45% in the first quarter to an average of $114 a barrel, the highest level in seven years.

&#x200B;

Oil prices rose sharply, supporting the performance of oil stocks soaring. The Biden administration just announced the release of 180 million barrels of crude oil, easing the pressure on oil surge. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the International Energy Agency will also announce the release of 120 million barrels of crude oil to ease the pressure.

At this time, oil prices are high to release national reserves, which can allow the country to sell at a good price. Then wait for the price to drop and buy it back. I guess a Biden administration would have figured it out long ago than buying and selling.

# [Stock futures are little changed to start the week](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> U.S. stock index futures were mostly flat Monday, as traders monitor the bond market’s warning signals about the economy.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded marginally higher. S&P 500 futures were up about 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3%.
*****
> Twitter shares surged more than 25% after SEC filings revealed Elon Musk purchased a more than 9% passive stake in the social media company. It comes less than a week after Musk polled his followers, questioning whether the social media giant follows free speech principles. Based on Twitter’s Friday closing price, the stake is worth $2.89 billion.
*****
> Tesla shares ticked higher by 1%, after the company reported on Saturday its latest quarterly electric vehicle delivery figures. The company delivered more than 310,000 EVs in the first quarter, up from 184,800 in the year-earlier period.
*****
> Meanwhile, Starbucks shares dipped about 1% after the coffee chain suspended its share repurchase program.
*****
> An often-cited recession signal was triggered Thursday evening when the the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields inverted for the first time since 2019. The 5-year note yield is also trading above its 30-year counterpart.
*****
> “We think the current flattening is due to the concern that the Fed is behind the curve on hikes and will tighten policy beyond neutral, which will hurt growth,” TD Securities said in a note to clients.
*****
> Investors are also monitoring the latest developments in Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that Western nations will impose additional sanctions on Russia in the coming days.
*****
> “Equity and bond markets continued to send conflicting signals about the economic outlook,” UBS said in a recent note to clients. “We caution against over-interpreting either signal. Yield curve inversions have historically predicted recessions with a long and uncertain lag, while hopes over cease-fire talks have ebbed and flowed,” the firm added.

*****
> Friday’s positive session came despite March’s employment report, which fell short of economists’ estimates. The U.S. economy added 431,000 jobs during the month, while estimates from Dow Jones called for 490,000.
*****
> “Strong gains on the employment front continue to signal a green light for investors despite multi-decade highs in inflation and concerns over higher rates and Fed tightening,” noted Peter Essele, head of portfolio management for Commonwealth Financial Network. “The economy appears to be in exit velocity mode, with the only concern being the amount of labor supply available to fuel the robust recovery,” he added.
*****
> On Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee will publish the minutes from the central bank’s March meeting, giving investors a deeper understanding into how the Fed views market conditions.

My 2 questions are - does it cost me more in fees to invest in VOO, VTI etc outside of Vanguard in a brokerage like Fidelity? I have a separate brokerage account with Vanguard but prefer Fidelity's service and interface.

2nd question would be, do you all recommend maxing my 401k BEFORE redirecting any money to my own picks above post-tax? I'm not sure if it would be worth putting more in 401 given the fund selection, or if I should go ahead and start buying my own outside of it.

U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by a seasonally adjusted 431,000 in March, below market expectations and the smallest increase since November last year.

The U.S. unemployment rate recorded 3.6% in March, which was lower than market expectations and continued to hit a new low since February 2020.

&#x200B;

Bloomberg Intelligence's chief U.S. rates strategist: The report appears to be enough to widen concerns that inflation will remain high, which could mean the yield curve will flatten further ahead of the CPI report later this month rise. Currently, the market is expecting a 17bps inversion of the 2Y/10Y yield curve by this time next year, and we see no reason to think that won't happen until the market has priced in.

\[After the non-agricultural announcement\] According to CME Group's ""Fed Watch"": the probability of the Fed raising interest rates by 25 basis points in May is 32.3%, the probability of raising interest rates by 50 basis points is 67.7%, and the probability of raising interest rates by 75 basis points is 0% By June, the probability of a rate hike of 25 basis points or 50 basis points is 0%, the probability of a rate hike of 75 basis points is 24.9%, the probability of a rate hike of 100 basis points is 59.6%, and the probability of a rate hike of 125 basis points is 59.6%. was 59.6%. 15.5%.

1862,Bond funds during period of rising interest rates,,"I'm sure I'm overlooking something big here, and I'm hoping someone can help clear this up for me. But to me, being in a bond fund right now is worse than holding cash. 

It seems very likely that interest rates will be rising over the next year or two--not guaranteed but highly likely. As I understand it, the value of bond funds (the NAV) will decrease as rates increase, and that has certainly been happening since last year. For example, VBTLX is down about 6% just this year. 

Eventually the higher interest rates will make bond funds more attractive, but for now you're losing more principal than you are getting in dividends (which is only 2% or so for VBTLX). And the losses should continue as rates rise. 

At some point the higher interest rate will offset the loss in NAV, but we seem to be a ways from that happening. 

So why bond funds and not cash during this period of rising rates?

1:11 AM ET, 03/24/2022 - Associated Press

NEW YORK (AP) — The Russian stock market opened Thursday for limited trading under heavy restrictions for the first time since Moscow invaded Ukraine, coming almost a month after prices plunged and the market was shut down as a way to insulate the economy.

Trading of a limited number of stocks, including energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft, took place under curbs meant to prevent a repeat of the massive selloff on Feb. 24 that came in anticipation of Western economic sanctions.

The significant restrictions on trading Thursday underlined Russia's economic isolation and the pressure on the financial system despite central bank efforts to curb market plunges. Foreigners could not sell stocks, and traders were barred from short selling — or betting prices will fall — while the government has said it will spend $10 billion on shares in coming months, a move that should support prices.

The benchmark MOEX index gained 4.4% as some companies partially recovered losses from the plunge on the day of the invasion. Airline Aeroflot bucked the positive trend by losing 16.4% — not a surprise after the U.S., European Union and others banned Russian planes from their airspaces.

Russian stocks were only a small part of emerging market share indexes even before the war and only for those with a high risk tolerance, given extensive cronyism, nontransparent accounting and widespread state interference. They lost any attraction for most foreign investors when the Moscow Exchange was dubbed “uninvestable” about a week into the war.

“The stock market is really almost a sideshow at this point,” said Chris Weafer, CEO at Macro-Advisory Ltd., a consulting firm. “It’s more a sentiment indicator because obviously companies are not raising any money on the stock market, and they won’t be able to.”

He said, however, that state-owned banks or funds may have been buying to support prices: “It does look like state-supported buying rather than any genuine interest on the part of investors.”

Government efforts to stabilize stocks and the ruble that has plunged in value are a way to show that some confidence was returning and “to try to get that message across to people not to panic, that this is a temporary situation that will improve,” Weafer said. Nonetheless, he added, the Russian financial system remained in a “fragile” state.

Tim Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said reopened trading was “deeply managed” and suggested that “for those Russians with some spare cash, there is nothing much else to buy as hedge to inflation and currency collapse.”

Restrictions like shutting down and restricting the stock market are among those that Russia has taken to shore up the financial system against utter collapse, but they also close off the economy to trade and investment that could fuel growth.

Some foreign hedge funds have expressed interest in shopping for distressed assets — viable companies trading at knocked-down prices — but they have no way to take part because of the trading restrictions, Weafer said.

A U.S. official called the severely restricted trading a “charade.”

“This is not a real market and not a sustainable model, which only underscores Russia’s isolation from the global financial system,” Daleep Singh, a deputy national security and economic adviser to President Joe Biden, said in a statement.

The economic turmoil in Russia from sanctions and the war has been severe. Hundreds of U.S., European and Japanese companies have pulled out of Russia. There have been bank runs and panic buying of sugar and other staples. The exchange rate of Russia’s ruble has tumbled.

Outside Russia, the reopening of stock trading on the Moscow Exchange has little impact, including on the vast majority of U.S. investors’ portfolios, said Leanna Devinney with Fidelity Investments.

The exchange's market capitalization — about $773 billion at the end of last year, according to the World Federation of Exchanges — is a fraction of that of major Western or Asian markets. In comparison, the total of all equities on the New York Stock Exchange is roughly $28 trillion.

Russia's central bank estimates that retail investors owned roughly 7.7 trillion rubles of stock, equal to $79 billion, as of late 2021.

Stocks last traded in Moscow on Feb. 25, a day after the MOEX sank 33% after Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Russia restarted trading in ruble-denominated government bonds earlier this week.

Roughly a week into the conflict, Russia was removed from emerging markets indexes compiled by MSCI after it determined the market to be “uninvestable.”

The London Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of 27 companies with links to Russia on March 3, including some of the biggest in energy and finance. The shares lost most of their value before that: Rosneft dropped from $7.91 on Feb. 16 to 60 cents on March 2. Sberbank plunged from $14.90 to 5 cents.",tpn2uh,9,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tpn2uh/russian_stock_market_crushed_by_war_opens_with/
1864,"Invesco is spending a lot of money advertising QQQ as ""access to innovation"". Does that claim hold up?",ETFs,"Note: I originally posted this in r/collegebasketball, but it got removed as they're more interested in bar graphs created in MS Paint so I'm posting here (Yes, I am a bit salty). I took out a section explaining ETF's as I assume anyone here has a decent grasp of what those are

**TL;DR** 

There are some innovative companies in the holdings of QQQ, but not near as much innovation happens here as the commercials would have you believe. Using the methodology described below, I (very subjectively) find the QQQ fund to have an ""innovation rating"" of **49.27%**. 

**Intro/Background Info** 

If you're watching the NCAA Basketball tournament, you've probably seen the advertisements for the Invesco QQQ fund, claiming investors are ""part of the team"" and ""taking part in innovation"". Tossing aside the dubious first claim (you're no more part of any team than Packers stockholders are; holding shares in an ETF doesn't even grant you voting rights), let's take a look at the ""innovation"" claim.


**Are companies held by the QQQ Fund truly innovative?**


As of market close on Friday, March 25th, the QQQ fund held stock in 101 companies (due to a quirk in Alphabet/Google's share structure, it actually holds 102 different stocks). The holdings can be found [here](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/qqq/holdings/). I've split them into categories below (percentages are of total holdings) and given them a very subjective rating of innovation. A couple of general rules of thumb I went by:

* Innovation, in my interpretation of the QQQ commercials, means one of two things: Either ""Something new that changes the industry"" or ""Marked improvement to a current offering that makes it better"". 

* Finding a better way to extract money from customers (ie. turning your product into a software-as-a-service rental) is not innovation in the spirit it's being presented to us.

**Methodology**

I assigned each category an ""Innovation rating"" in which I used my own subjective judgment to assign a rating from 0 to 1 that represents how much I think the company embodies the spirit of ""Innovation"" as the commercials for QQQ present to us (with 1 being ""true innovator"" and 0 being ""no innovation whatsoever). Each category's rating is multiplied by the percentage of the fund's holdings in that category to create a weighted average innovation rating for the QQQ Fund. That number comes out to be **49.27%**. 

* Notes: If you don't like how I've rated companies, make your own post. Also note that the percentages don't *exactly* add up to 100%, the fund holds a little bit of cash as well. Also, you can easily buy stocks in these companies individually. You don't need QQQ to own shares in these companies for you if that's what you want. 

**RATINGS**

**Big, Old Tech Companies** (Innovation rating:.4)

 These companies are the big players in the tech industry. Are they innovators? I give them an innovation rating of .4 as they do create new products regularly, but their main innovations buying up anyone that actually innovates and turning the software industry into an unfortunate hellscape where they collect absurd amounts of data on you to sell, make minimal changes and sell them as a ""new product, or turn their products into ""rental contracts"" that they have all the power over. 

* Apple (12.53%)

* Microsoft (10.06%)

* Google Class A (3.94%)

* Google Class C - No voting rights (3.76%)

* Facebook (3.35%)

* Netflix (1.22%; I almost moved them to the category below as, while they changed an industry, they've clearly lost the first-mover advantage and media consumption is quickly returning to a cable-style landscape where we pay for 50 things we don't want to watch just so we can get the one thing we do want to watch)

* Adobe (1.49%)

* Baidu (0.27%; real big in China)

**Archaic Tech and Telecom Companies** (Innovation rating): 0)

While these are tech companies, they operate on old business models and haven't done anything new for over a decade, thus I can't abide calling them ""innovators"". Mostly they get by on being the biggest (or only accessible) provider of their service. Anyone creating an online retailer or auction service gets put in this category as the timeframe for calling that ""innovation"" has long passed

* Amazon (7.35%; Amazon has grown so large and conglomerated that it's hard to categorize, and there are some decently innovative tech offerings like AWS, but for the most part the ""innovation"" that Amazon does is something someone else does first that is either copied or acquired by Amazon)

* Ebay (0.25%)

* Sirius XM (0.19%)

* AirBnB (0.46%)

* Charter Communications (0.71% heard of Spectrum?)

* T Mobile (1.15%; I might be a little unfair putting them in this category, but the very-consolidated telecom industry as a whole has shown that innovation is nowhere near its primary focus)

* Comcast (1.55%)

* Booking Holdings (0.68%; heard of priceline.com?)

* Mercado Libre (0.46%)

* JD.com (0.27%)

* Copart (0.22%; specifically deals with selling cars through online auctions)

* Pinduoduo (0.15%)


**Computer Hardware, Network Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity** (Innovation rating: .9)

By far the biggest category in terms of number of companies, this catch-all category represents tech companies that exist by staying ahead of the curve. In the case of cybersecurity firms, it's because they contractually have to, but most of the companies here would easily fall by the wayside if they quit innovating (at least until Covid put a bottleneck in semiconductors and chip manufacturing). I could easily split this into smaller categories, but they'd score similar ratings in my very subjective system

* NVidia (4.37%)

* AMD (1.44%)

* Cisco Systems (1.66%)

* Verisign (0.17%)

* Intel (1.54%)

* Broadcom (1.88%)

* Qualcomm (1.31%)

* Texas Instruments (1.25%; they do a lot more than make calculators!)

* Applied Materials (0.90%)

* Micron Technology (0.64%)

* Analog Devices (0.63%)

* Lam Research (0.57%)

* Marvell Technology (0.46%)

* Palo Alto Networks (0.45%)

* ASML Holdings (0.42%)

* KLA Corporation (0.40%)

* Fortinet (0.40%)

* NXP Semiconductors (0.37%)

* Synopsys (0.37%)

* Crowdstrike Holdings (0.34%)

* Cadence Design Systems (0.33%)

* Microchip Technology (0.32%)

* ZScaler (0.24%)

* Skyworks Solutions (0.17%)

**Business and Financial Tech** (Innovation Rating: .7)

These companies fulfill some tech need of businesses. I give them a somewhat high innovation rating as most have transformed some aspect of business over the last decade, but the score suffers as sometimes the changes are either faulty, unwelcome, or just plain arbitrary, and they're frequently the target of customer complaints

* Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (0.67%)

* Zoom Video Communications (0.21%)

* PayPal (0.99%)

* Fiserv (0.47%)
 
* Cognizant Technology Solutions (0.35%)

* Workday (0.35%; ""cloud based human capital management"" sounds pretty dystopian, doesn't it?)

* Paychex (0.34%)

* Atlassian (0.30%; a company that does ""software for software developers"", I almost put them in the Big, Old Tech group because, while coming up with the fairly popular Jira 20 years ago, they spent most of the past decade buying up other innovations without coming up with any of their own)

* Datadog (.29%)

* Verisk Analytics (0.25%)

* Splunk (0.17%)

* Okta, Inc. (0.16%)

* Docusign (0.15%)

**Innovation Companies** (Innovation rating: 1)

Non-Biotech companies that provide a new class of product. Strangely, they're either electric vehicles or medical equipment

* Tesla (4.62%)

* Lucid Motors (0.32%)

* Intuitive Surgical (0.74%)

* Dexcom (0.33%)

* Align Technology (0.25%)


**Retailers** (Innovation rating: 0)

Old companies that exist to sell other companies products. Pretty self-explanatory why the innovation rating here is a big fat zero

* Costco (1.81%)

* O'Reilley Automotive (0.34%)

* Wallgreens Boots Alliance (0.30%)

* Dollar Tree (0.26%)

* Ross Stores (0.23%)

**Food and Beverage** (Innovation Rating: .05)

Mostly old companies that get by on flagship products that have been around longer than most of us have been alive. Avoids the 0 by occasionally creating something new

* PepsiCo (1.67%)

* Starbucks (0.73%)

* Mondelez International (0.62%)

* Keurig Dr. Pepper (0.39%)

* Kraft Heinz (0.35%)

* Monster Beverage (0.30%)

**Non-IT infrastructure** (Innovation rating: .7)

These companies represent ""things that get built"" that aren't computer related. Buildings, aircraft, materials, they all find themselves here. The relatively high innovation rating represents a lot of innovating that we don't see

* Honeywell (0.98%)

* CSX Corporation (0.59%)

* Autodesk (0.34%; included here because, even though it's a software company, it's a major part of this industry)

* Ansys (0.20%; included here for the same reasons as Autodesk)

* Old Dominion Freight Line (0.27%)

* Fastenal Company (0.24%)

* PACCAR (0.23%)

**BioTech** (Innovation rating: 1)

Companies in this area either find new products or cease to exist. A true ""innovate or die"" world, though if a company is big enough it can ""innovate"" by acquiring the real innovators or providing the infrastructure for the real innovators to scale up

* Amgen (0.97%) 

* Gilead Sciences (0.54%)

* Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (0.53%)

* Moderna (0.53%)

* Vertex Pharmaceuticals (0.47%)

* Illumina (0.39%)

* IDEXX Laboratories (0.33%; this company focuses on veterinary applications)

* AstraZeneca (0.28%)

* Biogen (0.23%)

* Seagen (0.19%)

**Financial services and Tax preparation** (Innovation rating: -.5)

I've separated this company out and given it a negative innovation rating, as the company is known for lobbying against updating the process of filing taxes, which I consider to be an anti-innovative practice 

* Intuit (0.97%)

**Video games and Dating** (.4)

The real innovative players in this field are much smaller companies, but occasionally one of these shows a flash of brilliance 

* Activision Blizzard (0.45%)

* Electronic Arts (0.26%)

* Match Group (0.22%; you'd be surprised how many dating services are all owned by this one company!)

* NetEase (0.14%; in addition to being a video game developer, Wikipedia states ""The company also owns several pig farms."")

**Hotels** (Innovation Rating: 0)

Nothing innovative about a hotel

* Marriot International (0.41%)

**Utilities** (Innovation rating: .2)

While improvements in power generation exist, the utility companies aren't innovative in the way the QQQ commercials would have you believe

* American Electric Power (.36%)

* Exelon (0.32%)

* XCel Energy (0.28%)

* Constellation Energy (0.13%)




**Non-Tech Business Support** (Innovation Rating: 0)

Founded as a laundry company, Cintas provides laundry services, restroom supplies, low-level medical supplies, and PPE to businesses

* Cintas (0.31%)

**Clothing** (Innovation Rating: .05)

The only actual clothing maker on the list, Lululemon survives off of one (admittedly pretty industry-changing) innovative thought made 20 years ago

* Lululemon Athletica (0.29%)",tp56y9,13,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tp56y9/invesco_is_spending_a_lot_of_money_advertising/

Stocks reversed on Tuesday after a choppy session yesterday that saw all three major indexes close lower following hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.372%, the highest level in over 12 months while the price of crude oil remained above $100 per barrel.

Yesterday, in prepared remarks to the National Association for Business Economics, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his commitment to fighting inflation, which he says can jeopardize an otherwise strong economic recovery. His comments sparked off a mid-day sell-off in the market, that was quickly bought up. 

Powell said, “We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability. In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

Moreover, Powell said of supply-chain disruptions, “It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain. In the meantime, as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.”

Powell’s remarks come the week after the Federal Reserve raised the interest rate for the first time in over two years.  by 0.25 basis points in order to fight the fastest pace of inflation in over 40 years. 

Remember, last month’s CPI did not take into account the spike in oil, natural gas, and metal prices stemming from Russia’s war in Ukraine. It’s very likely March CPI numbers (due April 12) are likely to be even worse. 

Acknowledging that inflation will likely stay higher for longer, policymakers have revised their forecasts higher. Inflation (as measured by core PCE) is expected to be at 4.1% this year, up from a 2.7% projection in December. By 2023, inflation is estimated at 2.6%, up from an earlier forecast of 2.3%. 

Russia’s war in Ukraine remains a focus, with investors. As of Monday, Ukraine refused to surrender its heavily-attacked port city of Mariupol to Russian forces. Energy and commodity prices, which are priced by international markets, have surged in recent weeks, with crude topping $100 a barrel. 

Officials in both countries have sporadically signaled a possible negotiation but attempts at talks have so far proven unsuccessful. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned recently that if discussions with Vladimir Putin failed, it could mean the start of a third world war. In my opinion, potential developments coming out of Ukraine and the possibility that the Fed hikes the interest rate more aggressively than expected are the two main risks faced by the market. 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rocketed more than 7% higher after the company delivered the first set of cars built at the newly opened Berlin Gigafactory. The factory is expected to eventually produce 500,000 vehicles annually and employ 12,000 workers.
* In its investor day conference, NVIDIA unveiled the next generation of GPU called H100, which are radically more powerful than the already industry-leading GA100 and RTX 3090. The GPU contains some 80 billion transistors. To put that number in scale, GA100 is ""just"" 54 billion, and the GA102 GPU in the RTX 3090 is a measly 28.3 billion. Personally, NVDA is my largest holding so I am thrilled. 
* NVIDIA also debuted its latest self-driving car technology platform, called Drive Hyperion 9 that EV makers Lucid Motors (LCID) and China’s BYD will use.

* Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday struck an agreement to buy insurance company Alleghany (Y) for $11.6 billion
* Alibaba (BABA) shares gapped up after the company announced it had raised its share buyback program from $15 to $25 billion. This could spark a series of share buyback programs across Chinese equities.

1874,"Question about the Efficient Market Hypothesis: You can't outperform the market, but... which market?",,"An investor who went to Wharton overheard me talking about finance at a diner the other day. He told me you can't outperform the market by stock-picking. My question is: Can you ""market-pick""? The Japanese stock market sucks, for example, compared to the US stock market. The cryptocurrency market probably outperforms everything else by a long shot, too. Does he mean you can't crypto-currency pick and out-perform the crypto market or precious-metal pick and outperform the precious metals market? My thinking is that each market differs in volatility, and the reward goes up with the volatility, and there is a smooth balance between risk and volatility such that you can choose a market with more volatility and reliably get more reward if you invest for long enough. Does this make sense?",teqgzf,11,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/teqgzf/question_about_the_efficient_market_hypothesis/
1875,"Fear index remains high, the Fed is becoming the ""number one killer"" of US stocks",News,"""With the gradual tightening of monetary policy, the Fed has changed from a 'friend' to an 'enemy' of the market. In this regard, investors should be wary of a spike in the 'fear index' associated with the S&P 500.""

That's basically what Bank of America strategists have been thinking about the near-term volatility in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX, a measure of the S&P 500's implied stock market volatility).

“Continued high inflation is transforming the Fed from a market volatility-producing institution to a volatility-producing, yield-damaging institution,” Bank of America strategists Nitin Saksena and Riddhi Prasad wrote in a report. institutions.” They added that this backdrop “makes us a negative influence on the outlook for the stock market”.

Data shows that the VIX index once soared to more than 35 after the escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Although it has now fallen back to around 25, the index is still at a high level compared with the historical average.

The change shows that markets are concerned about the economic risks posed by intense conflict, high inflation and one of the most aggressive tightening cycles the Federal Reserve is brewing in decades. So far this year, the S&P 500 is down nearly 8%.

In addition, according to Stuart Kaiser, head of equity derivatives research at UBS, investors also need to pay attention to the difference between the CBOE 20+ 20-year Treasury ETF Volatility Index (VXTLT) and the VIX index. Currently, the difference between the VXTLT and VIX indices is positive and rising.

When that happens, stock returns are typically low, Kaiser said. In other words, a trend of sharp swings in U.S. Treasuries could be an ominous sign for the stock market.

1884,Investing in App Harvest (APPH) - interested in your opinion of my analysis,,"Hello,

I recently did some research on the Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) sector. What really interests me about it are the efficiency gains in terms of water/land usage and yield that can be achieved compared to ""traditional agriculture"". I also know that there are still some problems that need to be solved (overall energy usage, types of crop to be grown etc.), but all in all I like the approach and technologies behind it.

Anyway, I don't want to discuss CEA but one player in this sector: [AppHarvest (APPPH)](https://www.appharvest.com/2.0/).

They are growing mostly tomatoes in one ""of world’s largest indoor farms in Appalachia"" and are planning to expand their business to four indoor farms by H2 2022 growing also strawberries and leafy greens.

Let's say that they had a very rough first year which is also reflected in the stock price and I'm actually not sure if they will be able to recover.

# Net Sales VS Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

If you look at their [10-K from 03/2022](https://investors.appharvest.com/node/7926/html#i27acac6cdf284555bb8fb5594f62b21c_91) they report the following for the whole year of 2021:

\- Net Sales:  **$9.050.000**

\- COGS: **$41.938.000**

Granted, they encountered some problems in their first year of operations and were not able to grow at full capacity and highest quality as it is shown on page five of their [Q4/2021 earnings presentation](https://investors.appharvest.com/static-files/d77f986b-e813-4542-a84b-cd39411e1a0f):

||Q1 2021|Q2 2021|Q3 2021|Q4 2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Yield (lbs)|3.8M|8.6M|1.5M|4.4M|
|Net Price / Lb.|$0.61|$0.36|$0.37|$0.69|
|Net Sales ($M)|$2.3M|$3.1M|$0.5M|$3.1M|

But let's assume for a second that 2021 went well and they were able to produce 8.6M lbs of tomatoes each quarter and sell them for $0.69 each. This would give us the following net sales:

\- 8.6M \* 4 \* $0.69 =  **$23.736.000**

So even under such an assumption their COGS is still almost 2x higher than their net sales which tells me that something seems to be wrong with their business model in general and I have my doubts that a business expansion solves anything here and I'm fearing that the Net Sales to COGS ratio might be similar for the other indoor-farms they are about to put into operation.

# Executive Compensation

Aside from the doubts about their overall business model there are also the Exec Comps in 2021 which leave me with a question mark.

The CEO of AppHarvest earns a basic salary of $250.000 per year (so far so good). But then there are the bonus payments ($1.500.000) and stock awards ($31.282.077) that seem totally exaggerated.

The same is true for the President which got a salary of $650.000 and stock awards for a sum total of  $22.567.690.

I mean I get that they are highly qualified professionals who probably works their asses off, however, AppHarvest is a startup (founded in 2017) and such salaries and bonus payments don't seem proportional, especially after such a horrible year.

# Conclusion

I'm not going to invest in this company for the aforementioned reasons. However, I still believe that the sector as a whole as a bright future ahead of it and that there are other companies which are a better choice for an investment.

# P.S.

I have posted a comparison of economical and yield projections made by AppHarvest during their [Dec 15, 2020 Analyst Day Presentation](https://investors.appharvest.com/static-files/5fe4670f-144a-4788-9728-01b72186f02b) with their actual results of 2021 in the r/AppHarvest subreddit should you be interested.

1903,Investing In China; Risk/Reward Li Lu thinks it is the market for value/sophisticated investors.,,"With investing in **Chinese stocks** there are **three type of risks** that investors are mainly concerned with and that you should think about, besides the business itself. I would like to note that there are always risks with investing, and there is always something to worry about so don’t let it trouble your view. I think **Mr. Market is very drunk** with investing in China, with really big swings on news. 

You should always look at the risks/reward and weigh them.

Full article risk, potential rewards, and videos about what Li Lu and Charlie Munger say can be found here:

[https://www.financialstockdata.com/article\_chinese\_stock\_market](https://www.financialstockdata.com/article_chinese_stock_market)

Here you can also find the snippet of Li Lu's interview where he says that he thinks it is the market for value/sophisticated investors. 

**The Risks:**

**VIE structure risk**  
The shares you hold when you buy Chinese stock on are Variable Interest Entities, these are shell companies of the company. The shell companies have contracts with which they own the right to the dividends and profits of these companies. In this sense you don’t own the company directly, so you do not own their assets. People are afraid the government will just remove them, I don't see why this would be a very logical thing for the Chinese government to do. 

This should be taken into account. If you are interested and have great investors' thoughts on it you can view **Charlie Mungers thoughts on it down below.** 

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdqlH2XcnwM**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdqlH2XcnwM)

**Government risk**  
The government has been tightening rules on big tech and been handing out big fines. But it has already stated that they will ease a bit again, so not really big risk in my opinion.

**Auditing and Delisting risk**  
The financial numbers and figures of these companies do not get checked by any United State regulators, with all other foreign companies this needs to be done on the American exchanges. For this reason, the SEC will delist stocks if an agreement is not reached. However, if can transfer your shares to Honk Kong shares with certain brokers if this happens and if you buy your shares in Honk Kong there is nothing going on.

**Moreover, both parties have stated that they want to work this out, there is news about this** [**here**](https://cnevpost.com/2022/03/11/china-us-expected-to-reach-consensus-on-audit-regulatory-cooperation-soon-report-says/amp/) **. A report stated that they expect to reach a consensus.** 

I do have to note that expecting to reach consensus is not the same as reaching consensus and the sec as stated that they just need certain things from these companies. 

Moreover, Beijing has released support for foreign listing, which can be viewed in the article [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-tech-stocks-rebound-dip-012706093.html).

**Potential rewards of investing in China**

These are real risks, but with the stocks dropping very hard in 2021, 2022 certain Chinese stocks could have become worth the risk/reward. **Crashes** are great places for investors to investigate and look.

In terms of the strength of the business and the price of the stocks, you get a lot of value. Tencent and Alibaba are great businesses with a competitive advantage trading at low prices in relation to their growth. Investors like Charlie Munger, Monish Pabrai started investing in Alibaba and Tencent in 2021.

**Economically** if you like looking at that China has a growing middle class and a strong growing economy ( with its cycles of course) which Chinese companies could benefit from.

People are very strongly opinioned on investing in China. I would like to see arguments if you disagree great tell me what you think.

1905,"Whilst Tesla continues to be priced for domination of automotive markets globally, it's EV mkt share continues to fall",Discussion,"Tesla""s mkts share of global EV sales was 17% in 2019.  In 2021 it was 14%.  It remains a trillion dollar company whilst VW Group, for example, has a $111 billion mkt cap and BYD only a $102 billion mkt cap, despite outselling Tesla in EV's in the world's largest EV mkts.

Just published figures from insideevs.com, show Tesla continues to lose mkt share in the two largest global EV mkts.

Tesla has fallen to 9th place with a 5.4% mkt share in Europe (YTD 2022), the second largest EV mkt in the world, but the most mature with 20% of car sales now EV's.  Volkswagen group by comparison holds an 18.7% share of the EV mkt - let alone the millions of ICE vehicles it sells:

https://insideevs.com/news/576496/europe-plugin-car-sales-february2022/

(Tesla does have an end of quarter push that should raise its mkt share a little)

In China Tesla was surpassed by BYD last year, pushing it into third place.  It remains so with a lowly 6.4% of mkt share YTD:

https://insideevs.com/news/576396/china-plugin-car-sales-february2022

Whilst Tesla Model Y sales have risen, Model 3 sales have fallen out of the top 10 sales, and no surprise with the BYD Han and XPeng P7 superior BEV's for less money.

BYD has sold a whopping 185K EV's already in China this year vs Tesla's 43K.  So many investors dismiss BYD as insignificant (and weirdly as a scooter manufacturer for some reason). Whilst Tesla still talks about a semi, BYD is selling fully electric trucks in the USA, to little fanfare:

https://en.byd.com/truck/ 

Globally they, as others, are already selling electric buses, refuse trucks, coaches, etc.  Tesla may just catch BYD this quarter with an end of qtr push, but BYD should surpass Tesla in total EV's sold this year. Let's just ponder that.  In 2022 Tesla will no longer be the biggest EV company by global sales, yet is priced 10 times the value of the company that will outsell it.

Whilst Tesla investors will shout about tech and self drive, they still don't sell any business to business automotive tech (unlike NVIDIA, INTEL etc).  Whilst the media focuses on Tesla's arduous, and dangerously publicly tested, push to full self drive, companies like Baidu are already offering fully automated robo-taxis in eight cities and doubling revenue therein every quarter:

Now it's absurdly over-priced to the fundamentals of the global EV industry, as it's rivals are absurdly underpriced by comparison.",ts4c53,10,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ts4c53/whilst_tesla_continues_to_be_priced_for/
1906,Overcoming selling at the wrong time?,Advice Request,"Wonder if anyone else can relate to this. I have an issue where I hold a stock DCA over time, as the stock usually falling. Then I’ll get into about 5-7% profits and rather than sell, I tell myself, nope gonna be disciplined and hold long term because I believe in this. Then my 5-7% green goes away and before I know it I’m back in the red sometimes deep red. This will happen multiple times until i end up getting so far in the red I’m stuck..or I end up getting out even/flat after months of holding. 

Did this with PARA, BRCC, and DOW to name a few 


Then alternative is selling to soon. I get my 5-7% sell out thinking profits are profits don’t be greedy, then the ticker proceeds to go 10% + percent higher. Recently did this with IUSG. Sold at 104  from 95ish now it looks like it’s going at least over 110 in the face of nothing but bad news in the world and markets…

Idk if I’m watching these to much or what to emotional maybe. 

How do you all decide on your entry, exits, and hold times? This market is so screwy I want to try to be long term but am so anxious to take gains, one week looks like the world is ending then In a day it’s party like it’s 1999….


Anyways, I’m just frustrated I went to like 40% cash 2 weeks ago thinking rates, war, inflation, gas prices we’d have for sure another drawdown.

I paid off my undergraduate loans about 8 years early and when I think of the money those payments could have generated in this past decade, ugh I want to  kick myself.

1918,Microsoft Investigating Claim of Breach by Extortion Gang,Company News,"https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3vk9x/microsoft-hacked-lapsus-extortion-investigating

Microsoft is investigating claims that an extortion-focused hacking group that has previously compromised massive companies such as Ubisoft and Nvidia has gained access to internal Microsoft systems, according to a statement from the company.

The hacking group, which goes by the self-designated name LAPSUS$, has successfully breached a wave of corporations recently. LAPSUS$ sometimes makes unusual ransom demands of its victims, including asking Nvidia to unlock aspects of its graphics cards to make them more suitable for mining cryptocurrency. The group has so far not made any public demands against Microsoft.

On Sunday, LAPSUS$ posted a screenshot of what appeared to be an internal Microsoft developer account to their Telegram channel. The screenshot appeared to be from an Azure DevOps account, a product that Microsoft offers that allows developers to collaborate on projects. Specific projects shown in the screenshot include “Bing_UX,” potentially referring to the user experience of Microsoft’s Bing search engine; “Bing-Source,” indicating access to the source code of the search engine; and “Cortana,” Microsoft’s smart assistant. Other sections include “mscomdev,” “microsoft,” and “msblox,” indicating whoever took the screenshot may have access to other code repositories as well.

Shortly after posting the screenshot, an administrator of LAPSUS$’s Telegram channel deleted the image.

“Deleted for now will repost later,” they wrote.

On Sunday, a Microsoft spokesperson told Motherboard in an email that “We are aware of the claims and are investigating.”

Earlier this month the group said on its Telegram channel that it was seeking employees inside companies who would be willing to work with them, including Microsoft.

“We recruit employees/insider at the following!!!!,” the group wrote on March 10, followed by a list of sectors such as telecommunications firms, large software or gaming companies, or data hosts. In the message, the group explicitly pointed to Apple, IBM, and Microsoft as companies they would be interested in. “TO NOTE: WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR DATA, WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE EMPLOYEE TO PROVIDE US A VPN OR CITRIX TO THE NETWORK, or some anydesk,” the message added, describing particular ways that the hackers may be able to access target companies’ networks with the rogue employee’s help",tjbat6,11,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tjbat6/microsoft_investigating_claim_of_breach_by/

*****
> S&P 500 futures were little changed in early morning trading Monday after the benchmark index’s best week since 2020.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down about 80 points, or 0.2%, as Boeing dropped more than 6% in the premarket after a China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737 passenger plane crashed. S&P 500 futures were near flat. Nasdaq 100 futures ticked down 0.2%.
*****
> Last week, the three major averages notched their best week since November 2020, boosted largely by growth stocks. The S&P 500 surged 6.1% from Monday to Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week 5.5% higher, and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite spiked 8.1%.
*****
> “After one of the best weeks in years, now the question is will stocks be able to hold those gains?” said Ryan Detrick of LPL Financial.
*****
> The S&P 500 recouped nearly half of its correction losses last week as investors received highly anticipated clarity from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates for the first time since 2018. The central bank signaled it expects to raise rates at its remaining six meetings this year.
*****
> Market participants are also monitoring the war between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned if peace talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin fail, it would mean the start of a “third world war.”
*****

*****
> Investors are also evaluating a rise in Covid cases in Europe stemming from an emerging variant.
*****
> Some market strategists are not convinced of the rally in stocks.
*****
> “Bear market rallies are the most vicious. The rally in equities over the past week was one of the sharpest on record. While it could go a bit higher ... we remain convicted it’s still a bear market and we would use this strength to position more defensively,” Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson said in a note Monday.
*****
> The economic calendar is relatively light this week but several companies report earnings. Nike and Tencent Music report quarterly results on Monday.

1921,what would you do? SPHD or GOOG?,Advice Request,"GOOG is $2736
SPHD is $45.75

So roughly 60 shares of SPHD for 1 share of GOOG.
How ever, GOOG is doing a 1 to 20 split soon; so roughly $137 a share. 

I would only buy one share of Google right now as it's all I can do. It will be in a Roth IRA which right now has split between VOO and SPHD. 

Other option is I can put the GOOG into my long term non IRA account and contribute to the IRA later on this year with more of SPHD.

I don't have a regular group to bounce ideas off of. Reddit is oftentimes too unfocused. There's got to be something I am missing out on guidance wise.

# **Big banks’ earnings and a hot inflation report could sway markets in short holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/big-banks-earnings-and-a-hot-inflation-report-could-sway-markets-in-short-holiday-week.html)**
*****
> Markets face what could be a hot inflation report in the week ahead and a batch of big bank earnings to start the earnings season.
*****
> JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock kick off the financial industry’s first-quarter earnings releases Wednesday, with Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs reporting Thursday.
*****
> The war in Ukraine will remain a focus, as investors look for any signs of change in the crisis.
*****
> Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said the first-quarter earnings reports from the financial sector will be important to a market considering the impact of the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates and aggressively tighten policy.
*****
> “We want to get a picture of how do they see the Fed’s plan... quantitative tightening, the liquidity drain, coupled with higher rates, affecting their clients and their business units,” said Krosby. “If you look at the XLF [Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF], on days it goes up, it’s the insurance companies because they’re raising premiums. Higher rates are good for banks, until, the belief is, the higher rates are going to hurt the economy.”
*****
> For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%, but the interest rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite was down 3.9% and the S&P 500 was off 1.3%. For a third week in a month, the jump in the 10-year Treasury yield topped 30 basis points, according to Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher. A basis point equals 0.01%.
*****
> The 10-year rose above 2.7% on Friday.
*****
> “It’s been on jet fuel,” said Schumacher. He said the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, got a boost in the past week from the Fed’s signal that it is planning to trim its balance sheet by $95 billion a month, of which about $60 billion will be in Treasurys.
*****
> The 10-year is important as a benchmark and also because it is a rate that affects mortgages and other loans.
*****
> “People are saying the balance sheet is going to cause the 10s to move quite a bit,” said Schumacher. He said he could not rule out a move in the yield to 3%, given the speed at which the yield has moved recently.
*****
> Economic data in the coming week could be a catalyst for another move higher.
*****
> The four-day holiday week is packed with economic reports. Some will be released on the Good Friday market holiday. The highlight is Tuesday’s report of March’s consumer price index, which is expected to top the 7.9% reported for February.
*****
> “It’s big. It’s the last key data point before the Fed meets May 3,” said Schumacher. A hot number, even in line with expectations, will encourage the market to expect a 50-basis-point hike, or a half percent, from the Fed at that meeting. The Fed began its rate hiking cycle in March with a quarter-point increase.
*****
> The producer price index is set for release on Wednesday. Data on retail sales and consumer sentiment are due Thursday. On the Friday market holiday, Empire state manufacturing and industrial production are released.
*****
> Barclays economists expect CPI rose 1.24% in March, gaining a stunning 8.5% year-over-year, the highest in 40 years. “We expect the annual rate of CPI to peak in March and move lower thereon, aided by positive base effects,” the economists wrote.
*****
> The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures deflator is released April 29, but CPI and PPI will both set the tone for that report.
*****
> “We’ve had such a sharp move in yields. Sentiment is so dour in rates, I wouldn’t be surprised if we got a relief rally in rates after we see the March CPI,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
> “While inflation pressures are still going to be here, I think March would be the peak inflation rate on a rate of change basis... You could get some rotation [in stocks] next week if you get a bond bounce,” said Boockvar.
*****
> Schumacher said the bond market will also be watching the Bank of Canada for an expected rate hike when it meets Wednesday, and the European Central Bank for comments on its bond purchases at its Thursday meeting.
*****
> # Earnings season
According to Refinitiv, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1% in the first quarter, but the financial sector is expected to see a decline of 22.9%.
*****
> LPL’s Krosby expects to see choppy trading. “I think it’s going to be a difficult quarter,” she said. She said investors will be watching to see how the market absorbs a 50-basis-point hike. Quantitative tightening, balance sheet reductions known as QT, is also a policy tightening.
*****
> “The QT could start next month. There’s a sense [the Fed] can’t wait any longer,” she said.
*****
> Krosby said she recommends a defensive focus, favoring consumer staples, real estate investment trusts and health care, as well as consumer discretionary names that emphasize cost savings for consumers.

> “I suspect at the end of next week, with the long weekend ahead, people will want to cut risk, but I suspect it could be a pretty rocky ride with CPI before we see that,” said Schumacher.

> # Treasuries Yields Blow Past Dividend Yields

> US Treasury yields have experienced a dramatic move higher as the market prices in continued rate hikes in the near future. With the increase in long-term Treasury yields, we're starting to see what looks like the end of a period where the S&P 500 and the 10-year Treasury fought back and forth over which asset class had a more attractive yield.

> As shown in the chart below, from 1970 right up to the period before the global financial crisis, the 10-year yield consistently yielded more than the S&P 500. As the Fed cut rates to zero during the crisis, though, the S&P 500 went on to see multiple periods where its dividend yield was in excess of the 10-year Treasury yield. With the recent surge in yields as the Fed embarks on what the market expects to be an aggressive rate hiking cycle, the script has been completely flipped. The 10-year now offers a roughly 125 bps higher yield than the S&P 500 dividend yield which is the widest spread since the fall of 2018 and before that, the fall of 2011. As the spread between the S&P 500 dividend yield and 10-year Treasury yield hits the low end of the GFC/post-GFC era, we would note that current levels are still roughly 200 bps higher than the historical average going back to 1970.

> # Bulls Head for the Hills Once Again

> After peaking at 32.8% two weeks ago, bullish sentiment continues to roll over as the S&P 500 has erased some of the March gains this week. After this week's decline of 7.2 percentage points in bullish sentiment, less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. While low, that is still a few percentage points above the weaker levels from February.

> ###### **([https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bulls.png))**

> Bearish sentiment in turn rose 13.9 percentage points which was the biggest one-week uptick since August 2019 when it rose 24.14 percentage points. At 41.4%, bearish sentiment is now at the highest level since the week of March 17th. That is an elevated reading and a big move week over week, but it is also well off recent highs from the past few months that were more than 10 percentage points higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bears.png))**

> The bull-bear spread tipped into positive territory for the first time in 2022 last week, but the big inverse moves between bulls and bears erased much of the past few weeks' move. The spread is down to -16.7 which is still 13.6 points above the late February low of -30.3.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> The big pickup in the number of respondents reporting as bearish didn't entirely come from the bullish camp. Neutral sentiment also shed a significant amount falling from 40.6% last week to 33.9%. That is essentially mean reversion as neutral sentiment now sits only a couple of points above the historical average.

> # Near Record Low in Jobless Claims

> This week's jobless claims release was significant in a couple of ways. For starters, the Department of Labor revised seasonal adjustment factors (more on that below) and second, the most recent print for the seasonally adjusted number hit one of the lowest levels on record. Claims came in at 166K which tied the number from two weeks ago (after revisions) for the second-lowest reading on record behind the week of 11/29/68. That week's reading was only 4K lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> As for continuing claims, this week's reading was higher rising from 1.506 million to 1.523 million. Having come off last week's low, that remains one of the strongest levels since 1970.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> Pivoting back to initial claims, while adjusted claims are at multi-decade lows, non-seasonally adjusted claims are very healthy but not quite at a record. At current levels of 193.1K, the only year with a lower reading for the comparable week of the year was 1969 (170K) but at the seasonal lows in the few years prior to the pandemic, claims were even stronger than they are now. So while unadjusted claims are strong, the seasonally adjusted number was even more eyecatching this week.

> As for why the seasonally adjusted number appears so much stronger, as shown in the second chart below, the current week of the year has historically been the second most consistent week of the year in seeing a week-over-week increase in claims. As a period with consistent seasonal headwinds, the seasonal adjustment would control for this by depressing the level of claims by a relatively strong seasonal factor. That usual increase was not seen this year as NSA claims were actually slightly lower falling from 196.8K to 193.1K. That means seasonal adjustment helped out what was already a strong number.

> Additionally worth noting this week is the DOL changed its seasonal adjustment methodology. The DOL fully describes the change in this week's release and links to further reading on the topic for those interested in going deeper into the weeds, but to briefly summarize: periods when the level of an economic indicator experiences historic shifts in levels as claims did in 2020 and 2021, multiplicative adjustment (which has been used in ""normal times"" like prior to the pandemic and from here forward) would tend to over or understate adjusted claims. Additive adjustment, on the other hand, is less affected by the actual level of the indicator meaning it would lead to more accurate approximations of seasonally adjusted numbers in times of sudden spikes in the series. This methodology has been used throughout the pandemic period. Now that claims have more or less returned to a more normal range of readings, the DOL sees it justifiable to switch the seasonal adjustment methodology back to multiplicative. While that does not mean too much for interpreting claims, that change in methodology has led to some large downward revisions.

> # 10 Things To Know About Inverted Yield Curves

> One of the biggest stories over the past few weeks has been the inversion of various points on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The more well-known 2-year/10-year yield curve spread inverted on April 1, 2022 for the first time since 2019, while the 5-year/30-year inverted for the first time since 2006 on March 28.

> What is a yield curve? The yield curve plots the yield of different maturity bonds, usually Treasuries. In normal times, a longer dated bond should have a higher yield than a shorter dated bond. Historically, after key parts of the yield curve invert, the economy eventually has moved into a recession. This is why these signals are quiet important.

> Here are ten things to know about the yield curve.

> * Yes, past recessions have been proceeded by an inverted yield curve, but by no means does it happen right away. Another way to put it is yield curve inversions have preceded all recessions, but not all inverted yield curves lead to a recession. Historically, when the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverts, a recession has taken place an average about 19 months later.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.5.22.png))**

> * What about stocks? “One of the bigger surprises for investors is that stocks historically have actually done quite well after previous inversions,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the S&P 500 Index gained another 29% on average and peaked nearly 17 months later after the previous four inversions.” The bottom line is a yield curve inversion is a warning sign, but by no means does that mean trouble is coming immediately.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.5.22.png))**

> * In the LPL Research Chart of the Day (shown below), here is how the S&P 500 has done after all the 2-year/10-year inversions going back to the mid-1960s. Once again, some of the more recent performance has been quite impressive.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-3-4.5.22.png))**

> * One thing investors seem to be ignoring lately though is the short-end of the curve. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) came out recently saying as much in Don’t Fear the Yield Curve. They concluded that the 2-year/10-year yield curve wasn’t a good indicator for recessions; instead the near-term spread between the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has been much better. Take note that the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has steepened significantly the past few months, reducing the chances of a recession. Speaking of the Fed, Chairman Powell said last month that the economy was on firm footing and would be able to withstand rate hikes. In other words, the Fed isn’t worried about a recession quite yet.

> * Along these lines, the 3-month/10-year yield curve recently was at its steepest level in 5 years! This has been our personal favorite part of the yield curve to use as a signal for a pending recession (as the 2-year/10-year has given false signals before) and if and until this curve inverts, we believe the odds of a recession on the horizon is limited.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4-4.5.22.png))**

> * Yield curves are one part of the bond market, but what the credit markets are saying is another (think of them as bond investors take on financial conditions) and we see a much different opinion here. Lately, high yield bonds have outperformed Treasuries ( Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield index and the Bloomberg US Treasury index), a clue the credit markets weren’t very worried about economic growth going forward. In the past, trouble starts brewing when high yield underperforms Treasuries.

> * Adding to this, spreads on high yield and investment grade corporates have both come back significantly the past few weeks. “To see credit markets showing major signs of improvement the past few weeks is a great sign that financial conditions are probably better than most think,” explained Detrick. “Yes, the yield curve is flashing some warnings, but overall the credit markets are saying don’t get overly worried just yet.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-5-4.5.22.png))**

> * Real rates (rates adjusted for inflation) are negative. With the 10-year breakeven rate, what the bond market thinks inflation will average over the next 10 years, currently near 2.8% and the 10-year Treasury yield currently near 2.5%, real yields are actually negative. Historically, negative real rates have been quite bullish for risk assets. The Roaring 1920s, then during the 1940s and 1950s, were the last time we saw an extended period of negative real rates. As history told us, those decades saw explosive growth and stock market gains.

> * Real yield curves (adjusted for inflation) are still upwardly sloping. Take note, we’ve seen real yields invert ahead of recessions in the past along with nominal yield curves (2006 and 2019 most recently), yet another clue a recession might not be as close as some fear. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs noted that nominal curves tend to invert more easily in high inflation environments (we can check this box now), suggesting it would take a deeper inversion than recent cycles to trigger a recession signal.

> * Lastly, the Fed owns nearly $9 trillion in bonds and 25% of the entire Treasury market. Who knows where yields would be if they didn’t own any, but most agree longer-term yields would likely be much higher. So maybe various yield curves wouldn’t be inverted or even that close to inverting? This concept is mere conjecture, but it is a note we’ve seen lately that is at least worth pointing out.

> There is a lot to digest here and this isn’t an easy subject, but the bottom line is the takeaway isn’t as simple as an inverted yield curve means a recession is imminent.

> # April’s Stellar Track Record

> April has been nearly perfect with gains steadily building from the first trading day to the last with only the occasional and minor blip along the way. DJIA has been up 16 Aprils in a row with an average gain of 2.9%. S&P 500 has been up 15 of the last 16 Aprils with an average gain of 3.1%

> April is last month of the Best Six Months November-April and when we begin tracking our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal. But before the “Worst Months” arrive, April’s solid historical track record could keep the current rally intact.

> April got off to its usual stellar start the first two trading days of the month, but some surprisingly hawkish remarks from the usually dovish Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard has stocks on the ropes today.

> Barring any major escalation in Ukraine, we suspect the market to log additional gains in April as the Best Six Months come to a close and then move sideways during much of Q2 and Q3. Likely testing the lows before rallying in Q4 and into 2023.

> Our “Best Six Months” switching strategy found in our annual Stock Trader’s Almanac which is basically the flipside of the old “sell in May and Go Away” adage. After decades of historical research, we discovered that most market gains occur during the months November through April. Investing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between November 1st and April 30th each year and then switching into fixed income for the other six months has produced reliable returns with reduced risk since 1950.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming holiday-shortened trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",tzft11,10,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tzft11/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/
1938,How to build a wallet related to a specific niche?,Advice,"Hello folks,

I would like to ask you for an opinion about how to find stocks related to a specific niche. I'm trying to find stocks from companies investing in for example lab-on-a-chip technology. What I'm doing is getting into the topic and trying to find companies that work with the topic in a sense, which is a very immersive and time consuming approach. 

I actually really like learning about the new things from the niche I'm investigating about. However, for someone that works along the 8h-17h commune, it can become very easy to stop investing because of the amount of input it takes. I want to continue investing in things I believe, but although I find many good information about the niche I'm pursuing, I collect very few companies with stocks on sale .

I must say that I am new on those things. I like doing research (I'm an academic) but I also realize that I need to invest and that I should do this for myself. So I am aware that I don't have the most efficient approach on how to find assets from a specific niche. I started learning about a fundamentalist approach towards investing (buy and hold) and now I'm trying to make that a habit. 

How do you find good assets from a specific niche?",tzffyj,7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tzffyj/how_to_build_a_wallet_related_to_a_specific_niche/
1939,Question on future US debt interest payments,,"Hi all, looking to see some discussion on what the implications of higher interest rates will be, specifically with regards to national debt. 

I read an opinion article on cnbc that essentially states that in 2021, 20% of taxes paid went towards interest payments, which went through at an average of 1.5%. 

The author then goes on to explain that with meaningfully higher interest rates, we could easily see a situation in which two thirds of taxes paid in the US end up going towards interest payments. 

Do you guys think this is a possibility? How do you think the government will react to this?",tzcag4,10,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tzcag4/question_on_future_us_debt_interest_payments/
1940,Would you consider WWE a good buy?,Advice Request,"I didn’t even know that the WWE was a publicly traded company. It’s not something that I have ever watched but I do know that they have a huge fan base that is very passionate. Would you say that this would be a good buy? If so, why? If not, why?

Looking forward to seeing your answers. Thank you!",tyl7ec,10,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tyl7ec/would_you_consider_wwe_a_good_buy/
1941,what is your go-to growth stock?,Advice Request,"Ive heard alot of people say at my age I should be more growth-focused rather than on income, as my strategy has always been the accumulation of dividend stocks. This makes sense when taking capital gains tax into consideration.

1942,4/5/22 SPY Daily TA,Industry Discussion,"  

Writing this from my new computer which I am very excited that it is finally fully setup and running like a champ! Cant wait to test it intraday tomorrow as my macbook air was struggling for sure with everything I had running at one time. 

Intraday today despite a morning start that looked initially to be bullish the bears were able to get control of the day. Of course, this was at the assistance of fed member Brainard who dropped the bomb about balance sheet reductions and the expedited timeline for the fed. This set the market in to quite the tizzy seeing a massive 0.5% sell off within 30 minutes of news dropping. Initially it looked like we may recover after a clear market over-reaction… thinking back to the Saudi oil field attack we had last week. However, after a small pop from the low of 453.8 to 455.5, the bears took back control and took SPY for an impressively bearish close below some key supports for a -1.25% close. 

The one thing I will be considering going into tomorrow if the markets took the opportunity to price in the FOMC minutes tomorrow and that the markets are assuming that JPOW had said and will be more hawkish than anticipated. However, it would not be surprising to see the markets react bullishly tomorrow morning before seeing a massive sell off once minutes drop. Historically thinking back that is how the last few FOMC meetings have gone. 

SPY today closed below a key “ level” of support of 452 today. The next support level is down near 448. It was quite the fight at 452.5 all day but I believe now that we broke below this support we may start seeing some more downside. 

&#x200B;

The daily chart for spy is quite bearish now. Looking back to March 29th we formed what I am calling the upper resistance at 462 and now we just may retest support down near 410 over the next month. Also today was the first candle closed BELOW the daily 8ema since March 15th. The bears tried very hard last week to close below but the bulls wouldn’t let it happen. In general a close below the daily 8ema is a bearish omen in the markets. We also broke the grey upward channel today officially. 

&#x200B;

The weekly chart is currently set up with another doji but any downward momentum from her will make it a true bear candle. The weekly 20ema and 8ema is still down near 445-446 which could be the target for the bears this week (that is also major supports on the daily chart).

&#x200B;

Apple despite a bearish day tested the support of its channel and it is too close to tell yet on the daily chart if its broke it officially. It did manage to close above its daily 8ema at 174.83 which is a more bullish close for Apple after a -1.89% day. 

But as you can see on both SPY and Apples daily chart their daily MACDs are ready to curl to sell signal and the RSI is looking bearish both near 58 and trailing downward now. 

&#x200B;

The VIX had yet another wild day. Opening at 18.55 before climbing all the way to 21.57 before market close. That is another massive day, at 16% run up from low to high is wild for VIX! Again the VIX though was the guide of the market. Despite the expect over-reaction and mid day bullish reversal once the vix continued its slow climb up we knew that was not going to happen. 

Historically 16.5 to 21.5 over the last year or so has been the average VIX Range so we are not at the upper level of that. A VIX back over 22 would be quite bearish also and could allow for some increased volatility that we surely have been lacking. 

I will be gone in the morning with some personal stuff so I am going to include all premarket levels to watch here as I will not have time to post in the morning. I will be back on the server for live chat hopefully by 12 at the latest.

1949,5 stockpicks of mine at today's stock prices,Fundamentals/DD,"Hi everyone,

Here are a couple interesting stockpicks (imo) at today's stockprices:

1. **Sprott Physical Uranium Trust**  (U.UN on the TSX): The safest way to get exposure to the uranium  sector. The uranium sector is evolving towards a growing important global supply deficit and the uranium price is still too cheap to incentivise new production for the future.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qgme2rdzhhr81.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=114e591d3949d569c5a625060ccf1f750e26ed24

In 2007 the uranium spotprice was at 134 USD/lb + add inflation between 2007 en 2022.

**Bonus:**  Sprott Physical Uranium Trust is aiming to get a listing on the NYSE stock exchange in 2022Q3. This will significantly increase the inflow of money from US retail and a group of US funds that only can invest in US  listed stocks.

2) **HURA etf** (on the TSX) or **URNM etf** (on US stock exchange, [https://urnmetf.com/urnm](https://urnmetf.com/urnm)): well diversified and well balanced 100% pure uranium sector funds

3) **Global Atomic** ([GLO.TO](https://GLO.TO) on the TSX): This well advanced uranium developer started the  construction of their DASA uranium mine end 2021. Start production end 2024, first uranium sale in 2025.

DASA has the highest grades in Africa. They will not need additional capital raises to finance the construction of the DASA mine, because they have  important revenues from a producing Zinc JV.

Global Atomic is also significantly cheaper than Nexgen Energy (another well known uranium developer), while Global Atomic will become a uranium producer a couple years before Nexgen Energy...

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvx53pjfihr81.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=859c88ba4a91e0d9e4191621fc0293ec7d980158

Compared to peers like Nexgen Energy, Global Atomic is still very cheap. Global Atomic has some serious catching up to do.

&#x200B;

4) **American Lithium** (Li.V on the TSX): An important Lithium project in USA

5) **Greenland Resources** (MOLY on the TSX): interesting Molybdenum project that is of strategic  importance for Europe. Europe consumes around 25% of global Molybdenum production, but Europe doesn't have Molybdenum production in Europe at the moment, and Molybdenum is important for Windturbines, for the tubes used for geothermal energy, ...

Depending on the alloy, molybdenum can improve strength, hardness, corrosion resistance, weldability and high temperature strength.

1954,Currently invested in funds - looking for ideas for more growth over long term,Advice Request,"Dad set me up with an ISA (tax free investing  for UK) My current positions is as follows : 

AXA Framlington Biotech,

Invesco European equity ,

Invesco UK opportunities ,

AXA Framlington Global Technology fund,
 
Invesco Global equity

Due to time in the market, all of these have made money in total - lowest being 10%, highest 141% from the global technology one (I’ll probably keep this) 

Now, while this is probably all great and impressive, and I’m very thankful, I’m away that if it was just our into something like VUSA or VUKE over the same period, my gains would probably be higher plus I would have received dividends to buy more stock with, further increasing gains. 

The other thing is I can afford to be more aggressive due  to the fact I’m 20 - I can afford the higher risk of investing outside of funds, plus dividends would be nice - the ideal scenario is higher growth plus a small dividend payment as this would be useful in my day to day life to cover expenses without selling things. 

What would you guys recommend ? I’m open to basically anything. Risk is OK but manageable - I’m not looking  to YOLO into SPY puts or anything lol. 

Some ideas of companies I’ve looked at so far :

Warehouse REIT 
Tesco plc 
National grid 
Unilever 

I’m based in the UK so LSE would be easier for FX reasons but I’m open to literally anything.

1956,Sustainable Materials & Technology in Clothing: The Allbirds Case,,"Path to profitability for sustainable materials and technology in the next 10-20 years looks good - specifically in clothing.

Take Allbirds for example. One of the only publicly traded sustainable shoe brands out, and advertising themselves as much more - recently releasing a clothing line. Their shoes are just the beginning.

$BIRD is essentially one of the biggest opportunities in the sustainable materials technology and clothing market right now. Their angle has virtually no competition, they're loved by big money, and show every sign they plan on being around for a very long time - and not primarily as a shoe company, but as a sustainable materials and technology company.

Also, it's been a while since a decent clothing line came to market. $BIRD sits around $6, with early investors having the opportunity to sell off their shares in the coming month. More or less an opportunity to buy at the bottom soon, if it isn't already. ...Can easily see a selloff to the $2 to $3 mark out of panic that the company isn't going about profit in a traditional shoe/clothing company way.

Allbirds looks like a solid long term buy, add, and hold. Especially with their positioning to wool and material supplies in New Zealand. Also, their status in the tech space has virtually no competition - a whole market for IT clothing and apparel to be tapped. Plus, the CEO is dedicated and passionate about life in general - and also very smart to partner with Adidas - who could more or less buy them with pocket change if they wanted.

Wondering now who else is on a similar path. Definitely others competing, but nowhere near the same level of exposure.

Ridiculous as this may sound, Allbirds is more or less the Tesla of clothing companies right now. And sitting pretty at about 6 bucks.",tun7nd,11,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tun7nd/sustainable_materials_technology_in_clothing_the/

The rest would be invested and used as discretionary $$. I am leaning toward a 5 bucket investment strategy with no annuity using various risk levels and drawing that to cover all expenses.

* Higher interest rates can also lead to a drop in the stock market, primarily due to it costing businesses more money to operate 
* Last week. the FED raised intertest rates last  for the first time in over 3 years, and warned of 11 more interest rate increases to come.  
* If you have a credit card, auto loan, student loan or mortgage, they are going to become more expensive  if you have variable interest rates. 
*  Student loan payments are also scheduled to restart after May 1, 2022, so your payments will increase as rates increase 
* Also, interest rates will increase for those who plan to borrow student loans, mortgages or auto loans in the future
* The FED hopes that by making it more expensive to borrow money, there will be less demand to borrow money for homes, cars and other goods that we borrow money for 
* Interest rates would increase by about the same amount as the Fed hike, usually within one to two billing cycles. 
* The rationale is, because it costs more to borrow, fewer people can afford things, so spending pulls back 
* The FED’s hope is that this will help slow down inflation, which, is at its highest levels since 1982 
* Policymakers estimate that 7 more interest rate increases will happen this year, bringing rates to around 2% by year end 
* They also expect 4 additional hikes in 2023, to bring the interest rate near 3%.   
* Higher interest rates can also lead to a drop in the stock market, primarily due to it costing businesses more money to operate

I understand the expiration / Greeks part of it - but how does one know when is the right time to sell? I assume that’s part of mastering your strategies which will continue to humble you over time. Someone from AmeriTrade was just telling me he had a guy who lost 6,000$ the moment he hit buy.

1977,[DD] My personal top 3 solar stocks right now,Company Analysis,"Solar stocks had a rocky year in 2021. Overall, the solar stocks market ended the year with a loss of 27% following a jump of almost 240% in 2020. Over the last few weeks, I've been researching the top solar stocks to buy in 2022 and I've found three that I think are a really, really good pick.

# Canadian Solar (CSIQ)

The name probably makes it obvious that this is a Canadian company which specialises in solar panel engineering, production and construction. Founded in 2001, Canadian Solar has grown steadily over the years. In fact, they have one of the biggest solar panel manufacturing capability in the world right now. They are vertically integrated and produce everything from ingots and wafers to cells and complete solar modules. Currently, they have a module production capacity of 22.1 gigawatts and that is expected to increase to 32 gigawatts by the end of 2022. However, you should know that all of their manufacturing is based in China so they can be a bit vulnerable if US-China relations become worse. Still, one trend that is visible in the solar industry is that the top 5 manufacturers are getting more and more market share and Canadian Solar is in the top 5! The other really great thing about Canadian Solar is their focus on battery storage projects. Solar-and-storage projects is what is currently driving the solar industry. These projects include both solar panels and the batteries necessary to store the energy output of those panels. Canadian Solar currently has roughly 21 gigawatts hours worth of battery projects across the world in their construction phase or just in the backlog. Plus, Canadian Solar have a total of 24 gigawatts peak of solar projects around the world, spread between North America, Latin America, Europe and the Middle East, China and the Asia-Pacific region.

One of the best things with Canadian Solar is that their projects are worldwide so they are relatively protected from specific geopolitical tensions although that also means that shipping costs are a big factor with the company. In fact, shipping costs and rising commodities costs is what drove Canadian Solar down in 2021. Key materials went up between 120% and 338% while shipping costs went up 159% during 2021 resulting in overall module manufacturing costs going up by more than 40%! This exposed one of Canadian Solar's weaknesses which is its low profit margin which makes it especially vulnerable to rising prices. However, this also means that Canadian Solar will benefit a lot more from stabilising or falling prices. If we see that, Canadian Solar could shoot up in price. Also, part of Canadian Solar's strategy is to keep parts of its solar projects and sell the power instead of selling the whole farm. That way, the company will have some steady income to balance out its earnings, which is really great and will make them much more financially resilient! Right now, the solar stock trades with a PE ratio of 29.3 and a forward PE ratio of 7.51! Their price-to-earnings-growth ratio is also just 0.6 which is extremely good value! Canadian Solar does have a lot of debt, roughly $2.2 billion dollars which comes up to a debt-to-equity ratio of 107.4%, but it also has a cash pile of $867 million so their financial situation is relatively stable. In my opinion, Canadian Solar is one of the top solar stocks to buy right now although you need to keep in mind that this solar stock is volatile and is correlated to shipping and materials costs so you need to keep an eye on them.

# First Solar (FSLR)

Unlike Canadian Solar, First Solar is an American company with American-based manufacturing (Americaaa, fuck yeaaah!). In fact, that is one of its main competitive advantages over companies like Canadian Solar. First Solar is less susceptible to hikes in shipping prices although the majority of materials necessary for solar panel production do come from China so First Solar does have some exposure to that. The other competitive advantage that First Solar has is the type of solar panels that it produces. First Solar produces solar panels that are better suited for utility-scale solar farms. Their solar panels are also more resistant to weather and have a better production consistency although their maximum efficiency is slightly lower than the panels of competitors like Canadian Solar and Jinko Solar. Still, this makes First Solar a very competitive choice for large-scale solar projects, especially US-based projects. Similar to Canadian Solar, First Solar has a lot of projects in the backlog with a 26.2 gigawatts worth of solar module shipments backlog as of now. With a current manufacturing capacity of 8.4 gigawatts, First Solar has enough projects for the next 3 years! Still, the company is expanding their manufacturing with new factories in India and the US and should reach a production of 15.8 gigawatts by the end of 2024. This does highlight a potential problem though. If First Solar is not able to keep up with the demand, they could start losing business to companies like Canadian Solar which have a much higher production capacity. To me, it seems like First Solar is trying to do a controlled expansion, which is good for their finances, but it can cost them their leadership in the market.

Still, First Solar is one of the most profitable companies in the sector precisely because of their approach. In fact, First Solar had a profit margin of 16% in 2021 and currently have a PE of just 15.9. However, they are anticipating reduced earnings in 2022 due to their expansion plans, but we are expecting to see a jump in EPS in 2023. Their forward PE for 2022 is only 29.15 although that is based on an estimated EPS of $0.41 dollars. The company's guidance for 2022 is an EPS between $0 and $0.6 dollars so their forward PE will probably be very volatile. This is also why I think First Solar may see another dip before the end of the year if they keep seeing increased costs. On the other hand, lower costs will be very beneficial for the stock price. Basically, you are taking a bit of a risk here with material costs. If you think that they will go up, then maybe wait out. If you think they will go down, then First Solar is a good pick. Overall, I think the company will do really well in the next 3 to 5 years. They are a leader in the solar field, they have good operations, they have a net cash position of $1.6 billion dollars on a market cap of $8.1 billion. As long as they manage to keep up with demand and control their expenses, the stock price of First Solar will keep going up.

# Enphase Energy (ENPH)

Founded in 2006, Enphase Energy focuses on designing, developing, manufacturing and selling solar energy solutions in the US and internationally. Enphase Energy's main product is the microinverter which converts DC to AC energy at the solar panel so that the energy can actually be consumed by the end user. In addition, Enphase Energy offer a storage battery in two configurations, 10.1 kilowatt-hour and 3.4 kilowatt-hour. They also offer a portable energy system which is used off-grid and offers huge possibilities in the Indian market. They are also developing Electric Vehicle chargers and fuel cells which are two new, but rapidly growing markets. Overall, Enphase Energy is a leading pure-play solar company with a high-quality product offering and a massive addressable market. In terms of manufacturing, Enphase Energy's main operations are in Mexico and India which was a strategic move to avoid being affected by US and China trade relations and possible tariffs. I think that was a really smart play on their side and shows real foresight from the management. Most solar companies have operations in China because you get cheap labor and easy access to the necessary key materials, but obviously it brings other issues. Enphase Energy's CEO has actually shown really good business understanding and strategic thinking over the last few years and that is really, really important.

Now, unlike Canadian Solar and First Solar, Enphase Energy is actually classified as a growth company. Over the next few years, analysts are expecting an average of 32.9% earnings growth and 20.8% revenue growth which is much, much higher than the rest of the industry and higher than its closest competitor, SolarEdge. Enphase's management is also focused on their 35/20/15 business model which stands for a target of 35% gross margin, 20% operating income and 15% operating expenses. Currently, their operating expenses are a bit higher, standing at 24% overall for 2021 although they have dropped to 16.5% for the last quarter of 2021. However, their operating profit is also higher at 25.4% for 2021 so that's okay. Plus, their gross margin has been steadily improving and currently stands at 40.2%, 5% above their target. Still, that model shows Enphase Energy's long-term plan and it's good to see they have such a plan in place. This is also something that a lot of investors like. Everyone loves predictability when it comes to investing. Enphase Energy is also less affected by commodity price increases and shipping costs than Canadian Solar and First Solar so that's another positive for the company. Still, Enphase Energy is trading at a premium because of its expected growth. Their current PE is 150.7 with their forward PE for 2022 being 50 or 56.8, depending on your source. Their price-to-earnings-growth ratio is 1.41 which is actually a bit lower than the sector median of 1.44, but it's still relatively high. Enphase Energy also has a net debt of $20 million dollars which is tiny given that their market cap is $23.9 billion. Overall, I think that Enphase Energy is a solid bet for the next 3 to 5 years. However, the price is a bit steep right now and doesn't really offer a big margin of safety. Also, given the fact that we have multiple expected interest rate hikes this year, growth stocks like Enphase Energy are likely to be hit with a lower valuation. Basically, my personal opinion which is not financial advice is that I would only buy a small amount of this solar stock and I would look for opportunities to add to my position over this year. Again, I am very, very bullish on Enphase Energy, mainly because of their Indian solar market bet. There are not a lot of companies that are targeting it and it is massive so Enphase Energy have a huuge opportunity there. But, again, I would be wary of going all-in on Enphase right now.

1985,"$NVT DD; a manufacturer benefitting from ""the electrification of everything""",Company Analysis,"Looked into NVT recently, so figured I'd share my quick DD with the community. As always, do your own research, this isn't personal advice, yada, yada, yada. 

[nVent Electric](https://investors.nvent.com/investor-relations/default.aspx) (NVT) is an electrical component manufacturer that owns brands like Caddy, Erico, Hoffman, Raychem, Schroff, and Tracer. If it protects and connects critical electronics and equipment, nVent probably makes it. 

The company divides its products into three segments: 

* **Enclosures**: metallic and non-metallic enclosures, cabinets, subracks, and backplanes.
* **Thermal Management:** heat tracing, floor heating, fire-rated and specialty wiring, sensing, and snow melting and de-icing solutions.
* **Elecrical & Fastening Solutions:** fastening solutions can range from bridle rings for cable management to clips for securing light fixtures to the ceiling.

Since the pandemic, nVent has steadily increased quarterly revenue and expects momentum to remain strong for the current year, even with supply chain challenges and inflation headwinds.  

Why? Because the company benefits from the broader electrification movement. Solar, data centers, data networking, automotive, oil & gas, infrastructure — these industries (and many more) all rely on electronics one way or another. nVent creates the oft-overlooked components that enable safety, constant up-time, and cost-efficiency. 

It helps to have a physical tie to the electrification of everything. Here are a few financial highlights:

* **Solid revenue growth.** 13% increase in revenue in FY21 relative to FY19; pandemic set the company back briefly. Management anticipates 6-10% growth in FY22. 
* **Prudent management of corporate costs.** SG&A is routinely 22-24% of sales. 
* **100%+ net income conversion to free cash flow.** (FCF of $334 million in FY21)
* **Decent forward P/E ratio based on FY22 expectations** (15.5, which is below the comparable average for electrical component makers of 20).

Compared to peers, there may be other opportunities with higher upside, such as WIRE and ATKR. (Based on yesterday's close numbers.)

|Ticker|Price|Market Cap|P/E|Revenue (TTM)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ABB|$31.79|$62.06B|13.9|$28.9B|
|EMR|$95.89|$57.13B|20.9|$18.5B|
|ROK|$271.05|$31.63B|31.6|$7.3B|
|AME|$132.30|$30.50B|31.1|$5.5B|
|GNRC|$296.96|$19.14B|35.8|$3.7B|
|RRX|$138.47|$9.32B|31.5|$3.8B|
|ST|$48.25|$7.66B|21.2|$3.8B|
|**NVT**|**$34.32**|**$5.66B**|**21.3**|**$2.5B**|
|ATKR|$90.24|$4.05B|6.1|$3.3B|

|AMOT|$27.38|$424.3M|16.5|$403.5M|
|PLPC|$62.74|$312.98M|8.7|$517.4M|

That said, shares currently trade at $34.50, representing a PE ratio of 21.5. Looking ahead, NVT trades at 15-16x forward earnings for FY22, which suggests — *all else equal* — there’s a chance for NVT to hit mid-$40s over the next year. ",tz6thq,8,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tz6thq/nvt_dd_a_manufacturer_benefitting_from_the/
1986,Satellite Technology Advice,," Hi,

so there's been some buzz especially as of late about satellites. Starlink helping Ukraine get service & Amazon getting more involved in sending satellites up. There are already a bunch of great companies and stocks out there that provide satellite info as well, Viasat, Lockhead, Boeing, Maxar, etc. So already some competition. Satellite's seem to be inevitable to helping the world connect to places they couldn't have before (middle of the ocean, better connection while flying, more stable ways to connect when in trouble, like Ukraine). I'm not a aerospace engineer or genius or know too much, but satellite technology seems to be a great tool in the future. Does anyone know of any stocks that help build satellites or satellite technology? or is the only way to invest as of now is a like space etf or one of these stocks that also provide satellite data?

I think it'd be better / safer to choose the stocks that help build these satellites than to choose one and then competition eventually crushes them? or choose one of the few ETF's (UFO, ARKX). I'm looking / willing to hold for a few years. I have tried digging into some of these individual stocks, so maybe one of those options is the one I'm looking for, but I'm wondering if you know of any that I am missing?

Thank you!",tye0ju,8,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tye0ju/satellite_technology_advice/

&#x200B;

Now, I have some stocks with Computershare, meaning they are sitting in the States. 

To my understanding, Germans would now fill out a W8 (W-8BEN) form so that the American broker becomes aware that the double tax agreement is relevant in this case and therefore Germans would only have to tax their profits from selling stock in Germany (25%). 

But in my case, I guess since I have an SNN, my account has a W9 Form attached to it. I have the option to replace the W9 with a W8, but apparently, the W8 applies if you're ""not a US person"", which I, as I understood, am due to my US citizenship.   


Does any of you know how taxation would work in my case? Does the double tax agreement still apply to me, since I live and pay taxes in Germany, or do I also have to pay taxes to the IRS due to my US citizenship, meaning that I would have to tax my profit twice?

2003,Batman taught Xi Jinping one thing...Vengeance,Fundamentals/DD,"**TLDR: Alibaba is the single best investment opportunity to make A LOT of money! China is loading their clips and will unload enormous support to their stock market delivering spectacular returns.**

>Fear is a tool. When that light hits the sky, it’s not just a call. It’s a warning. For them. - Batman

Batman has taught Xi Jinping that it is time to act today! This write up is as long as the Batman movie so I have added my slideshow so you can stare at pictures:

[**Slideshow**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zdqTj74oDrV1bROrN3GGKvLRYD8lFKlE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114395166790266874172&rtpof=true&sd=true)

""All Sales have an expiration date.""

Alibaba is a complex business that we cannot pitch on a page. Alibaba has been written up countless times, and we feel that there is still more information to offer. We became interested in BABA around **$210 a share** and researched the stock for the past six months. As of Tuesday, we believe a unique situation occurred that turned a great opportunity into an amazing opportunity.

**Summary:**

Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is one of the highest-quality businesses globally, maintaining a historical return on capital of roughly 18%, owning numerous subsidiaries and cross-holdings. The business is broken into five business segments: commerce, cloud, media and entertainment, innovation, and cross-holdings (87%, 8%, 4%, 1% of revenue) {cross holdings market value equalled 36% of BABA market cap.}. Although people recognize Alibaba as the Chinese Amazon, it is more like Google because they make more money from adverting on their sites rather than selling products. 

As of March 15, 2022, Alibaba traded at:

* **4.81x P/E (Minority Holdings, Cash, and ST investments removed)** 
* FP/E (with cash and ST investments) = 11.2
* ROC = 14%
* Market Cap = 294B
* TEV = 224.5B
* P/B = 1.73
* FCF Yield = 26.2%
* Price to FCF = 6.73
* ROE = 15.52%

BABA is expected to grow:

* revenues by 32% in next two years
* earnings by 30.7% in the next two years

In the past seven years, BABA grew:

* Revenues (per share) by 894.9%
* Cash Flow (per share) by 559.5%
* Earnings (per share) by 601.9%
* The share price has changed by 0% 

Recent fears have led to a 70% sell-off, tanking the market cap to a low of 196 billion dollars. Pessimism is at an all-time high; an analyst (I'll be nice and not use his name) gave a price target of $65 where nearly a year ago it was north of $300. Nothing has fundamentally changed, and the most considerable risk is China (this was why he downgraded); it is not a new risk... he is a lunatic. This example shows the fear that analysts are jumping ship when signs of change are evident.

A large MOAT protects Alibaba, and its cloud business has the potential to grow bigger than its current market cap alone. People are acting as China has never probed or cracked down on equities before. The core business has grown efficiently throughout enormous fines and regulations. The past year has been challenging for Alibaba; no other way to put it. Nevertheless, BABA still delivered 14.4% ROC and solid top and bottom-line growth. Removing fines and regulations, Alibaba had an outstanding year. Organic growth will continue and provide above-market returns shortly.

Record low multiples and continual growth through the most challenging market should be highly enticing to investors. 

**Thesis:**

1. The most significant risk (CHINA) is overblown. Understanding the two central policies by the Chinese governments allows a better understanding of their crackdown and recent actions. This week the catalyst was finally given by the CCP stepping in to help boost the equity markets.
2. The underlying business will continue to grow double-digit revenues and earnings for the considerable future. The MOAT of their Cloud delivers growth for the next decade. The commerce portion is competitively positioned to take a significant share in the international market.
3. The valuation is Ludacris!!!!!! 
4. Tuesday announcement creates liquidity and buy-side pressure that has never been possible. Allowing banks, insurance companies, and underwriters to own more stock in China develops an unchartered situation and will likely deliver outsized gains.

**Risks and Mitigants**

Starting with the risks we believe is helpful for readers, most people know about the company and why to be bullish; however, we have not seen anyone dive into China to explain the explicit risk and why we believe it is far overblown.

China's risk is mainly due to the recent actions taken by the CCP and Xi Jinping. Timeline of events:

* 2.8 billion Dollar Antitrust Fine against Alibaba
* DIDI Removed from AppStore
* Tutoring stocks become non-profit
* Alibaba pledges 15.5 billion to shared Prosperity
* DIDI Delisting announcement
* Evergrande Defaults

US investors flooded out of Chinese equities; however, we do not believe that any of these actions were unexpected but predictable. The Chinese communist party has two main focuses Common Prosperity and Dual Circulation. As a result, the sentiment is at all-time lows, and many believe China is uninvestable. On the contrary, we believe China is highly investable and delivers the best bargain in the entire market with Alibaba.

Common Prosperity:

It is the goal of creating a vast middle class and reducing the poverty levels in China. They try to do this by focusing on areas where citizens either overspend or struggle to obtain services. For example, a massive market surprise was that they turned for-profit tutoring non-profit. That announcement created enormous amounts of fear in the equity markets. This occurred because the goal was to offer tutoring to all students, not just those that could afford tutoring services. It makes sense that they do this because limiting education will create a wide disparity between the upper class and lower class. 

To understand how the government acts, you must understand the goals of their policies. Ray Dalio made a good analogy; think of the CCP as strict parents; they want the ""best"" for you and sometimes overshoot trying to achieve that before realizing they have gone too far.

We are not fearful of crackdowns because of historical events. The most recent crackdown occurred in 2018 when there was a probe on video game companies. Initially, the CCP claimed that video games were going to be banned... As a result, investors fled out of these equities, and fear was extreme in Chinese equities. They still have video games today. A key to understand is that the CCP has historical evidence that they overshoot with regulations in the short term and during the intermediate to a long time ease the rules greatly. 

performance of Videogame stocks:

* Tencent (-37%) went on to rally 150% 
* NetEase (-41%) went on to rally 165%

Alibaba will benefit over time from Common Prosperity, delivering uncommon returns. They have pledged 15.5 billion, and a larger middle class will create wallet expansion, directly providing more revenue and profit to Alibaba. 

A quick note on DIDI is that we believe that they were rightfully delisted. They had 30+ violations before IPO and did not address these issues by national security. If this occurred in the US likely, the company is not even allowed to delist. In recent news, a Chinese official explicitly stated that they support IPOs abroad. 

Dual Circulation:

The CCP's second goal is dual circulation. They are working on improving their internal economy while participating in global trade to double GDP by 2035. Hindering your superpowers (Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu) and causing fear will not lead to goals being met. We have seen their policies and actions show that they have realized they have overshot with their regulations, and we believe will aid in the recovery. March 17, 2022, regulators in china said help is coming, tech regulations are nearing an end, and they will buy stocks while improving monetary policies while the rest of the world is tightening policies. This is a critical point that many investors overlook; there is a very low probability of actual harm in Chinese equities any further. The fear is overdone, and this slow bleed-out is over. 

Understanding that to double their economy, they need companies like Alibaba to succeed because they are the most prominent Chinese company with access to international markets and will dramatically improve exports and manufacturing. The global market will be a direct player in the success of China, they need the world, and the world needs China. So there is no way around not having Alibaba in the mix.

Recently China has been buying planes from Boeing, which could signify they are excited to work with America rather than fight them. This is one example. Nevertheless, there are countless other ""uncharacteristic"" outreaches towards better trade. Investors must overlook the media talking points, as they are inaccurate. The actions are louder than words.

We do not believe that Zero-covid nor Evergrande is significant enough of a real risk to the Alibaba thesis. Evergrande default debt is in their currency (Yen), so it is manageable, and the government is stepping in and aiding in the situation. During the Evergrande announcement, Alibaba acquired a small 8-billion-dollar chip manufactured at a ridiculously cheap valuation, which is a positive. Zero-covid will likely be easing over the coming months, and we are confident that the end is near with the pandemic. This will result in another bullish outlook in China.

Statistical Analysis of China:

A statistical piece of evidence regards the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, where The Hang Seng index has rallied 24% leading up to the national congress party. This is based on 5 data points (1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017). Going into the Chinese ""election,"" the last thing you want is a suffering economy and the hyper-wealthy to be upset with you. 

Post-market recession, the MSCI ETF has returned 31% in the following 12 months. Alibaba, we believe, will outpace the ETF over the short and long-term, yielding much more substantial than 31% returns over the coming 12 months.

The Hang Seng index has traded below book four times in history, and Alibaba has doubled the Hang Seng each of those times. Instances Hang Seng fell below book. 

Hang Seng Recovery after trading below book:

* 2016: 85% in 23 Months 
* 2020: 35% in 11 Months

Alibaba during the same time:

* 2016: 234% 
* 2020: 71% 

**Analysis of Business:**

BABA is broken into five businesses, and only three are worth talking about. Media entertainment and innovation are tiny and do not move the needle. The commerce, cloud, and cross holdings are the most critical aspects to this company. 

Commerce:

Making up 87% of revenue and delivering most of the profit growing at a 34% Revenue CAGR over the past seven years demonstrates the power of this Chinese Giant. Many people compare commerce to Amazon, and we do not think this is a good comparison for investors. The stores operate similarly, but most revenues come from the sellers paying for push ads like seen in Google. This is how BABA can maintain such strong margins. They also have very successful logistics services that improve delivery times and efficiency. For example, one of their subsidiaries, Cainiao, is 2x more efficient than a regular warehouse. Growth in china retail is slowing. However, they will continue to grow and maintain a robust bottom line for the foreseen future.

Chinese commerce growth is not the best reason for investors to like the commerce portion. They should be excited over the international growth potential. This is where the enormous market potential lies. The three notable names are Trendyol, AliExpress, and Lazada. A good reference is that the TAM for Chinese retail is only growing by 26% over the next five years, whereas the international retail market will grow 66%.

First Trendyol is their Turkish subsidy that is competing well against Hepsbiruda (NYSE: HEPS) {HEPS is my subsequent write-up}. Second, the Lira is finally stabilizing (We believe the worst inflation in Turkey is now over), and the bottom line should instantly improve. Third, they are growing and collecting insightful data that will transition into the rest of the middle east. Finally, being a market leader with only 12% penetration shows the vast market growth potential. The middle east is a largely untapped market, and we believe that the new users can result in ample opportunities soon. Researching MOMO (Smallfish42 had a good write-up if interested) delivered valuable insight; they plan to expand into the Mena region. These regions are not first-world countries but are the fastest growing youngest population globally. By the time the core of their population is in the 25–35-year-old range, phones and technology will substantially advance, and infrastructure will be in place. This would, in simple terms, argue that companies like MOMO (TANTAN in particular) and Trendyol are being undervalued mainly because of the favourable demographics. We strongly believe that Trendyol will be able to take significant advantage of the location, whereas companies like Amazon are not having as much success.

To further the bull case for Trendyol is the Google model. Unlike Amazon having tight margins, countries that will not spend as frequently as fully developed countries will keep their margins even thinner. Alibaba makes money off advertisers, which are more insulated to purchase frequencies.

Lazada is the southeast Asian version that has done much better than expected and has grown its penetration and top line for countless quarters. Revenue rose 43% YOY, consumer stickiness has improved for seven straight quarters, and an assortment of products is now being rolled out. With 11% penetration, we believe this will likely deliver strong growth for the next 2-4 years.

Lazada will continue to improve penetration, and we believe that the quality of consumers they are obtaining and will obtain will become vastly profitable. Many analysts thought entering southeast Asia was an enormous risk with minimal possibility of success. The contrary has occurred and will continue. 

The most exciting out of the three is AliExpress. We believe this has the most opportunity and is an immense opportunity for growth in the commerce section. AliExpress grew their sellers on site by 132% last year. This allows investors to see that buyers are on the other end if sellers are aggressively coming. They hold two huge advantages and the first being pricing power. First, they can go right at Amazon in international competition due to connecting to many manufacturers. Next, their brand recognition is significant in the global market.

As noted by Jeffery Towson via China Market Research: ""AliExpress is effectively Alibaba at its most opportunistic."" we strongly agree with this statement. AliExpress will begin worldwide shipping in 72 hours for a $3 monthly subscription, and there is 0 competition at that price point. No one… not even Amazon; their premium costs nearly $30+ for a monthly subscription in some parts of the world. We believe this value proposition will create an even large MOAT over the coming years. Their cash balance can support the price. 

Alibaba is focused on the long term, this is something that management preaches, and we believe it is imperative. They are concentrated in the year 2036 to reach their goals, and they have a track record of creating enormous value over time. Their long-term vision gives management of subsidies to operate without forcing rapid growth and making educated long term decisions. An example is Freshippo. In 5 years, they were able to reach a 10-billion-dollar valuation. They are slowly and efficiently growing the company to a valuation where they now hope to take it public.

Alibaba has focused on spending large amounts of Capex to improve their international markets exposure because they realize they have the infrastructure and ability to dominate over every potential competitor. An example is that Amazon has spent enormous amounts on planes and trucks, whereas Alibaba has spent on Wearhouse efficiency, nearly fully automating Cainiao factories. Another area is self-delivering vehicles that are 1/3 of the cost and 40% quicker at delivering the last mile. 

The critical takeaway is that TMALL and Taobao are great. They are reaching mature cycles, and the transition by management has been fantastic. They have improved consumer stickiness by 1.8x while growing their loyalty programs by 50%; these we believe are key with significant competition growing with JD,.com (NYSE: JD) and Pindupduo (NYSE: PDD). This demonstrates the value proposals the customers are accepting. 

The value expansion and growth will slow dramatically in the two flagship Chinese commerce stores, and investors should not worry or use these two businesses to base earnings. The new growing markets are not in China. They are global. BABA has positioned itself well to compete and dominate, taking market share. TMALL and Taobao will continue to deliver, but multiple expansions will occur from Lazada, Trendyol, and AliExpress growth prospects. 

Cloud:

The single best reason to invest in Alibaba is the cloud space. Alibaba controls 38% of the Chinese cloud market share. They have an enormous advantage, like AWS in America. The cloud is nearly non-existent in terms of earnings and has a considerable potential to be a primary driver of profits in the future. Operating margin expansion will grow to a minimum of 30%. This will further enrichen their margins and ROC.

Amazon states their cloud operating margins at 30%, but they misrepresent this by inputting their internal cloud costs. We computed a 34% operating margin and believe that they will continue to improve their operations. This is something that many analysts seem to miss. Maybe this is what our good friend at JPM skipped over when he delivered a $65 PT... or perhaps he just missed everything. We believe that Alicloud is a very close comparison to AWS. They both have substantial market share and operate similarly.

The Chinese cloud market is poised to grow quicker than the global cloud market by 16%. As a result, China's cloud at one point will likely make up close to 1% of their GDP, and currently, it makes up 0.1%. 

The cloud market is multiplying and will likely occur in China on a lagged basis. The CCP and governments will need cloud, companies and organizations will begin to use cloud software. We are very bullish on the cloud industry and believe Alibaba is the cheapest way to make a significant play on cloud software. Alicloud is going to deliver continual growth by improving the underlying service. As they improve the software, they are not hiking the costs. We believe this is the correct move with such market dominance by managing to begin to take market share and grow in international markets. In addition, Alibaba has already started to develop in-house microchips, which will cut their cost significantly and deliver less dependence on chip manufacturers. This will allow more cloud data to be used while spending less on their hardware costs to maintain the cloud without outages.

Cross Holdings:

The final aspect of the business analysis is the cross-holdings. Their current market value equals 70 billion dollars. Doing valuations for each allows understanding the quality businesses that Alibaba finds and backs financially. This delivers good insight into how management thinks and how they will likely spend money in the future.

The list of companies we did total DCF Valuations for include:

\- Hello Group Inc.

\- Bili Bili

\- smart

\- Mango Excellent

\- STO Express

\- YTO Express

\- ZTO Express

\- Red Star

\- Focus Media

\- Ant Financial

It became evident that Alibaba has some interesting investments. The express companies are all logistic companies that operate in Asia. Many of the companies are not attempts at unicorns but highly stable and predictable businesses that will be of benefit to Alibaba. Management seems to favor quality and insight over promised money tomorrow (high multiple stocks). 

**Microsoft Comparison:**

History does not repeat, but it sure does rhyme. 

Microsoft from 2006-2013:

\- Revenues grew 112%

\- Earnings grew 121%

\- Cash flow grew 193%

· During the same time, the share price did not change. The combination of the weakened valuations and strong buybacks (2010 mega-caps like AAPL, MSFT, SBUX… used buybacks to try and elevate very compressed valuations) founded an enormous market rally. 

Microsoft from 2013-2020 rallied 1500% with multiple readjustments and continual value creation.

Alibaba from 2013-2021

\- Revenues grew by 894%

\- Earnings grew by 602%

\- Cash flow grew by 559%

During this timeshare, the price has not changed. Investors can buy Alibaba at 2013 prices with 6x improved fundamentals. Alibaba has issued a 15-billion-dollar buyback program. They currently have 7 billion (estimate) left to spend on buybacks.

We added this comparison just to demonstrate how times of worry and lacklustre results create far above-average returns over the coming years. Of course, we understand that the underlying businesses are different, and MSFT never was forced to deal with an extensive regulation. However, these situations are similar where they were trading at absurdly cheap valuations and issued large buyback programs.

**Valuation:**

With very different businesses within Alibaba, we used a SOTP valuation. There are three good comps (Amazon, JD.com, and Pinduoduo), and the others (Tencent, Baidu, Coupa, Snowflake, Google, Microsoft) operate in one of the key business segments to BABA. We valued each minority holding and added it back and removed majority holdings to the proper percent of ownership.

Historically Alibaba has traded on a yearly avg. Price to an earnings range of 24-33x, the median is 29, and the mean is 28.33.

Relative Valuation:

The three main competitors (JD, PDD, and AMZN) are not nearly as cheap as Alibaba… Alibaba performs better in each category (Unadjusted TTM P/E, Unadjusted NTM P/E, EV EBITDA, EV/REV, OP. MARGIN) aside from EV/REV, which JD.com was cheaper. Considering that JD.com's operating margin does not compete with Alibaba, so they are forced to sell more to yield the same dollar value.

DCF:

Since we cannot add charts or tables in applications, I will briefly walk through the SOTP valuation. We used a model like Aswath Damadoran and do not use exit multiples but calculate for ""infinite growth.""

Commerce: we believe that the predictability is still at large. In the most recent quarter, earnings grew by 10%. However, guidance was not changed, and their goal is 20-23%. We believe that this is more than doable; the government interference will be at lows for the first time in 12 months. We believe that the value creation will combine the growth of the international subsidies with improving top-line overcoming three years, while Tmall and Taobao deliver larger margins as they mature and minimize spending.

Cloud: the continual growth will occur at double digits for nearly next decade, the addressable market is massive and being top four globally and number in China holding 38% of market share. We believe that the real growth occurs when non-tech companies transition to cloud software needs, this will create an even bigger market and deliver higher margins because needs will be less than the current users, most big tech companies. The margins we believe can grow north of 30% operating margins.

Cross holdings: We believe the intrinsic value is near 120 billion dollars. They have seeded some highly successful stocks and others who operated very effectively in their respective regions. For example, they own profitable shipping and logistics companies in Asia.

Ant Financial is a big area where nearly 50 billion is locked up until the IPO; we believe that regulators are not overstepping because Alipay and Ant are primarily connected to the Chinese consumer credit and need to have an infrastructure in place before going public. This is a catalyst and is currently, in our opinion, the same as restricted cash. Many investors believe that the Ant IPO will reach 300-500 billion valuations. We believe this is mainly steep. However, we can imagine American investors would essentially like to invest, creating overvaluation.

Simplistic base case:

Alibaba will not be as affected as the market believes by the government delivering a valuation that likely trades at a PEG near 0.15. This is paying nearly nothing for future growth. We believe that Alibaba will continue to grow in the international and Chinese markets. The cloud will become to impact earnings materially over the coming years. The market is so pessimistic that when Alibaba turns around, there will be enormous margin expansion to the mean. We value Alibaba on a SOTP valuation of **$303.41**. Based on our analysis, Alibaba cross-holdings will not grow materially over the coming years, growing 6.4% a year. We believe this is mainly conservative and delivers **even more** safety in buying the stock. The float is being bought in aggressively, making the valuation much higher over the coming quarters and years. The return on capital and FCF yield will begin to grow along with the growth of the cloud business.  

Analyst Accuracy:

Analysts have been largely inaccurate, especially struggling in times of crackdowns. The data goes back to the fourth quarter of 2014. Overall, BABA earnings have outperformed analyst expectations by 6% over the past eight years. Analysts have struggled to create price targets during crackdowns. BABA has beat 17 earnings and missed 11, with nine being related to crackdowns. This demonstrates that when the air clears, Alibaba will likely return to exceeding expectations and reverting to the mean of 6% avg. Beats.

The average price target for Alibaba is $159.36, which we believe is fundamentally cheap, and the analysts have shown to consistently change price targets related to fear or greed in the market. Looking at many of the recommendations seems to be a contrary indicator. This low-price target represents 40%+ upside. This is a considerable margin for safety, especially with our 303-dollar price target.

**Buyback:**

Alibaba issued a 15-billion-dollar buyback and has 7 billion dollars remaining. We estimate that by the time they have fully utilized their buyback, they will have reduced the shares outstanding by 5-8%. This is a meaningful buyback that will deliver enormous benefits to shareholders; they will be able to continue to buy their float in for the coming years.

**Moat:**

 Alibaba operates a defensible MOAT. They have brand loyalty and have been improving consumer repeats. They have years of data over competitors and have shown to understand wallet expansion better and position themselves to capitalize on these consumers over competitors.

The next defence is pricing power. Compared to Amazon in the international battle, there is an enormous discount in pricing power. Therefore, unlike America, they can compete on price in international fighting, which is much more critical in these global markets. Moreover, the power of their manufacturing connections delivers enormous possibilities to take market share based on pricing. This will hold off local companies.

**Special situation:**

We believe that this week delivered an enormous opportunity for all Chinese equities. I have seen the countless write-ups on Alibaba and was hesitant to write however with the news from Tuesday I believe I was obligated to write this report. As stated in the State Council address of the public that the tech cramdown was nearing an end, they will support tech and housing companies, stimulate their economies using monetary policies and new loans, and state the insurance companies increase their exposure to stocks.

This news, we believe, is a special situation because of the effects that will directly help Alibaba. This will likely deliver enormous amounts of support to Alibaba price and may change market sentiment (the main reason for the plumet).

Ending of crackdown:

The government realizes they have overstepped in their actions. Deciding to turn tutoring non-profit laid off nearly three hundred thousand people, and after the cuts from tech companies, a million-plus Chinese citizen will likely be out of work due to regulations. They have realized that time to ease restrictions is needed. Looking back to Common Prosperity, this makes sense; laying off a million people creates large amounts of poverty.

Support of the economy:

The monetary policies will include stimulus, and they will not expand property tax. This is very exciting for two reasons. The first is that monetary stimulus equals higher spending, and being directly affected by weak Chinese consumer spending (recent quarters) will likely reverse and deliver strong sales over the year. Alibaba will likely re-capture the sales missed in Q1 by weak consumer spending. This is another bullish indicator to point to the company's 20-23% expectations to be accurate. The following reason that this will benefit Alibaba is that the property tax will aid home builders and the Evergrande situation. Many new developers will begin as they will not have to deal with higher tax expenses. This also shows that communism and capitalism can co-exist (this is one of the largest reasons to be a BABA bear); holding taxes relatively low is more of a capitalist approach. They are also issuing new loans that will directly be pumped into their economy, benefiting their dual circulation system strengthening Alibaba's domestic sales. This will correlate easily to the bottom line and deliver almost 30% FCF for investors.

Insurance:

""China's banking regulator said that it would support insurance companies to increase investment in stock markets."" The insurance regulator stated that trusts and wealth management would be asked (by communist gov, which means do!) to support and stabilize capital markets. The stock investments made by these entities will likely be a benefactor to Alibaba. In addition, many of the investors and insurance companies will probably invest in the highest quality large cap. companies to ""mitigate risk"" This will deliver liquidity and buy-side pressure that has rarely, if ever, been this present.

Delisting and accounting:

The state continued to discuss how good progress between American and Chinese governments has been working on improving transparency in the accounting of Chinese equities. This is spectacular news as this will likely bring trust from foreign investors and deliver more liquidity from investors who were primarily feared of delisting due to the inaction of the Chinese government**.**

**Other risks:**

Russia-Ukraine War:

This seems to be the one thing that still possess fundamental risk to Alibaba. We do not think that Alibaba is the only stock at risk because every company faces direct geo political risk regarding the Russia Ukraine war.

2004,Bull Case for $HD (Home Depot),Company Analysis,"Hi friends, I am not an expert stock trader/investor by any means but I thought I’d mention how Home Depot is a solid buy for me. Home Depot is currently the 27th most valuable stock by market cap, and I think it will continue to grow.

1. In the 3 month chart, SPY is down 4% whereas HD is down 22%. I don’t think HD deserved to be hit harder than SPY in this bear market, so I think putting your money into HD has higher potential for growth than companies that went down in proportion with SPY.
2. Bears on HD are mentioning that people remodeled their house a lot during the covid pandemic but the pandemic is coming to an end. My response: People really will find any reason to be bearish. Not every stock is a pandemic stock. Google is a pandemic stock too because people will stop googling about covid, etc. 
3. I think people don’t realize that Home Depot is not just a store that sells hammers and nails. They deserve to be put in the same category as companies like Walmart who always have potential to do more.
4. The “Home” category is generic enough that they have potential to break into many different other industries. I could definitely see them competing with companies like Best Buy in the tech industry (did you know that Home Depot sells TVs?). They could also venture into industries like furniture, maybe compete with IKEA. 
5. The company has a good reputation for being a reliable and friendly company that treats their salaried employees well (yes their minimum wage employees will probably have things to complain about but that’s every company).
6. They are dominant in both brick and mortar stores and in ecommerce. What’s not to like about that?
7. I’m not well versed enough to look at their financials and judge their stock price based on that, but they are way down from their ATH, and I just think the stock market is a ponzi scheme anyway that doesn’t have much connection to the fundamentals like that. Home Depot has no signs of doing poorly as a company, and quarter after quarter I expect their price to go up at a faster rate than SPY.",tp10fq,8,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tp10fq/bull_case_for_hd_home_depot/

2007,Cash-rich Japanese gaming company that buys back shares aggressively,Fundamentals/DD,"GungHo Online Entertainment is a Japanese gaming company that has had stable free cash flow since 2016. They have a very high amount of net cash and are selling for a very low price; EV/FCF has been around 3-4 in the last couple of years. The price seems cheap to me, so the only concern I had was whether they would return that cash to shareholders. They are indeed doing so, having bought back 8,8% of shares in the last nine months. I have made a DCF in which I expect FCF to decline 2% a year for the next 7 years as a result of increasing competition. If we want a 12% return and apply a hefty margin of safety of 20%, fair value would be 25% below the current price.

**Financials**  
GungHo is a gaming company that has shown they can create hit games and decently maintain popularity of these games. The release of Puzzle & Dragons in 2012 caused a big surge in earnings, which then dropped down before stabilizing and slowly growing since 2016. Similair to a lot of Japanese companies, GungHo has a very healthy balance sheet; their net cash (115B yen - 14B yen) make up **60% of their market cap**\*.\* As mentioned before, earnings (and FCF) have been stable since 2016. Comparing their EV of 67B yen (168B yen - 101B yen) to their financial results over the last couple of years makes for an EV/EBITDA ratio of 1.8, EV/Earnings ratio of 3.8 and EV/FCF ratio of 3.5

**Shareholder value**  
I think it's clear that the company is selling for a cheap price. My personal biggest concern for this company was whether they would provide shareholder value. I have looked into a handful of cheap Japanese companies, and a DCF would often make it seem like the stock was a great investment. The problem would always be that the company doesn't actually provide (plenty) shareholder value; they would sit on a pile of cash yet, best case scenario, would pay a 3% dividend and not buy back any shares. So, my main focus for this company is whether they would actually provide shareholder value. To my surprise, it seems like the company absolutely does provide shareholder value. **In the trailing nine months, the company has bought back 8,8% of shares outstanding.** I don't think I've ever seen such an aggresive buyback. It's also good to note that they cancelled most of these shares immediatley after buying them back. The fact that they have bought back shares so aggressively tells me that they care about returning cash to their shareholders.

Initial Explanation

One of the market's most popular instruments, $VXX, recently underwent an anomaly of an event that hasn't occurred in over 10 years in the volatility-trading space. **On March 14, 2022,** [**Barclays**](https://ipathetn.barclays/cms/static/files/ipath/press/Press%20Release_03_14.pdf) **announced a suspension of share sales and issuances on the iPath® Series B S&P 500® VIX Short-Term FuturesTM ETNs (BATS: $VXX).**

Ok, so what?

The reason that I bring attention to this announcement is as follows:

Generally speaking, the $VXX is built to track the first- and second-month VX futures on a rolling basis. Barclays, the issuer of $VXX, doesn't actually hold underlying futures contracts to maintain the ETN, rather, it tracks the performance of the underlying futures contracts on a rolling basis. The product that the ETN tracks is known as the net asset value (NAV) or ""indicative value"" of the underlying ETN. Issuers use NAVs as a metric to match their ETN prices to their NAV. Essentially, in order for Barclays to maintain the publicly traded product, they match long and short order flow on their ETNs. For example, if a trader wanted to buy 1,000,000 VXX ETNs in one transaction block, **Barclays will** ***usually*** **issue 1,000,000 shares of VXX to keep the price of the ETNs the same.** On traditional shares of stock, however, 1,000,000 shares of stock in one transaction block could change the stock price due to an increase in demand and a shortage of supply. **Equities, unlike ETNs, do not issue shares of stock for order flow to keep the price of the security at its NAV. Whereas, ETNs generally issue notes to keep the ETN price at its NAV.**

The breakage

Considering that Barclays is no longer issuing shares for their $VXX ETNs, long order flows will not result in the issuance of new shares.

So, what does this mean?

Let's say you purchase 1,000,000 shares of stock, similar to the equity example made in the last paragraph. The purchased shares are no longer issued by Barclays to keep the price of the ETNs at their NAV. Rather, the **existing market participants must sell their 1,000,000 shares of stock to you**. Due to the increase in demand, **the price of the ETNs will increase past their NAV.**

Where is $VXX trading now relative to its NAV?

$VXX is trading approximately $3.00 above its NAV (approximately a 12% premium). As more investors purchase $VXX, the share price will continue to rise until authorized participants or Barclays announce the resumption of share issuances. Eventually, however, Barclays will announce the resumption of share issuances, which will result in a fast, and certain, decline back to $VXX's NAV.

Has this happened before?

Yes. On February 22, 2012, [$TVIX (a 2x leverage front- and second-month VIX futures ETN) experienced a suspension of share issuances](https://www.etf.com/sections/features/11092-creations-of-velocityshares-tvix-halted.html). $TVIX continued to rapidly rise (high of 90%) above its NAV for an entire month before the announcement of resumption of share issuances was released (March 22, 2012). Once share issuances resumed, $TVIX crashed nearly 60% in 2 days back to its NAV.

How can this be traded?

Well, until Barclays announces the re-issuance of shares, traders could take the long approach and trade the upside that $VXX could experience. After all, $VXX is a volatility product. Volumes generally increase when markets experience volatility. $VXX's value could drastically surpass the current \`12% premium value given the price discrepancy between its ETN value and NAV. On the contrary, once the announcement occurs, traders can enter short delta trades using the options market, which is generally liquid on a product such as $VXX (may not be as liquid due to the current crisis).",tld5cg,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tld5cg/barclays_broke_vxx_dd_trading_opportunities/
2013,ETF price: how is it settled?,ETFs,"I think I get it how prices of individual stocks are set during a trading session: there's bid and there's ask, people sell to other people willing to pay the asked price. That's pretty straightforward. Now, an ETF is a bundle of stocks. Nobody own ""pieces"" of an ETF, its prices is dictated by the prices of the stocks in its composition, right? Nobody is buying or selling VOO, there isn't a supply of VOO stocks somewhere, people are buying and selling Apple and Microsoft individual shares and that dynamic dictates the price movement of an ETF. Am I getting this right?

Now, what about VUAA.DE, an ETF traded in Germany that follows S&P 500? When the German stock market opens, the US stock market is closed. What moves the price of VUAA.DE then, since no one is trading Apple and Microsoft shares at 09:00 UTC.",tkwfvl,8,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tkwfvl/etf_price_how_is_it_settled/

# Company Description

Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues.

# Thesis

SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations.

This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4!

I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis:

This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering).

What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good.

More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no.

In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher.

Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). For now just know shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185.

Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace.

Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3

My post from November 2021: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle\_me\_simo\_mega\_memory\_upside\_v2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/)

# Current Valuation & Financials

Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x

Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22

* Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value.

Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x

Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22

* These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth.
* This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP \[in PCIe Gen 5\] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs.
* Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed.

EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22

* You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product)

Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22

* Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept!
* Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21

Analyst Price Target: $110

* Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120.

# Technicals & Market Mechanics

SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. (See Appendix for charts)

SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

# Upcoming Catalysts

Once again, a long list of event catalysts around the corner.

SIMO

* 3/23 Bank of America APAC TMT Conference 2022 (SIMO; potential pre-guide and/or capacity updates)
* 5/5 SIMO ER
* Now - 4/5, 5/6 - SIMO has expressed desire to accelerate their buyback program. Outside of the 30day pre-earnings blackout period, buybacks should kick in big time

Industry

* 3/23 U.S. Senate hearing on semis supply chain ""Developing Next Gen Tech for Innovation"", featuring execs from MU (25% revs) & INTC ($8.65% revs). Discussions will revolve around investment in Federal investment in semi mfg supply chains & America COMPETES Act 2022 & CHIPS for America Fund (potential $52bil to support US semi mfg fabs).

Key Supply Chain Ers (\~50% of Revs represented)

* 3/29 MU (25% Revs); this is THE biggest catalyst for SIMO, and thanks to current memory market dynamics, MU should have a total blowout
* 4/7 Samsung (3.3% Revs)
* 4/28 INTC (8.65% Revs)
* 4/28 Fujitsu (1.2% Revs)
* 4/28 SK Hynix (4.89% Revs)
* 4/29 WDC (4.23% Revs)
* 5/6 Arrow Electronics (2.2% Revs)

2019,"Hello guys, looking for clarofication between 3 fund and 2 fund portfolio",,"Hello my friends. I'm new here and I hope my post is not in breach of the sub's rules, it is not personal advice, just a general query on the Bogleheads 3 fund portfolio. I notice that this portfolio advocates for the equities to be split between US stocks and Intl ex-US stocks  and then bonds (with variable weighting to your taste)

I also notice that Buffet is a big advocate of a 90/10 split for S&P500/1-3yr Gov bonds. With both this and Bogleheads 3-fund performing similarly over 40 years (depending on weighting)

So my question is this: if you do prefer the benefit of global diversification over US concentration risk, why not simply go for an all world fund like VWRL (where US is approx 60% weighted anyway) Isn't putting your cash into fewer pots better for long term compounding... Why would you split into 2 funds where 1 can do the job of both? Is there a benefit to doing this?

All I can think of in terms of benefit of 3 fund is that when the time comes for retirement and you are liquidating your investment and (theoretically) at that period the US and Intl ex-US have performed differently, you can liquidate one and perhaps let the other stay a little longer?

There isn't a straight forward answer i've been able to find on this so far. Thanks for any help or insight.",tiro8o,7,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tiro8o/hello_guys_looking_for_clarofication_between_3/
2020,Advice on opening a brokerage account,Help Needed,"So I am new to investing and do not have anything actually invested yet, but I’m tired of my money sitting in checking and not accumulating anything. I would like to start a long term retirement type account where I invest consistently each month into SPY and just let it grow and never touch that money. I don’t want to do an IRA because of the yearly contribution limit as well as the salary cap. However, I have also been reading about dividends, and have been hearing about how nicely after a couple of years they can start to pay off. My questions is: is it possible to have my long term stock account that I explained above give me my desired monthly/quarterly dividend payments? I know there are companies within SPY that give dividends, but I’m not sure how to go about this through that main account. Or do I need another investment account where I solely invest in companies with large dividend percentages like Pepsi, Coca Cola, Waste Management etc. I have a list of about 14 stocks to invest in with high but consistent dividend payouts, so I’m not sure if I need two accounts. One for my long term retirement account and one for just focusing on investing in a few specific companies for the sole purpose of generating a medium/large dividend payout in about 10–15 years. Sorry if this is very confusing, again I am new to all of this so I am just trying to learn! Any advice is much appreciated!



Edit:
TLDR: one or two investment accounts? One for long term and the other solely for the purpose of a monthly dividend payout? Or one account that does both? Thank you!",tia12a,8,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tia12a/advice_on_opening_a_brokerage_account/
2021,MLPs and Charitable Giving,,"I’m trying to understand if there are any tax benefits to donating master limited partnership (MLP) units to charity. As MLPs distribute dividends in the form of return on capital, making these tax-deferred and lowering the cost basis, can’t you just wait until your cost basis is $0 and then donate the units to charity to avoid paying LTCG on the entire unit price?

I’ve tried to find more info on this and it seems very sparse and somewhat unclear. The best I could find was a [Forbes article from 2010](https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2010/12/02/tax-guide-to-master-limited-partnerships/?sh=1a4b28b670d1) which stated:

“Don’t donate depleted MLPs to charity. Since they are pregnant with ordinary income, your deduction would be limited to the stock market appreciation in the shares. (Buy at $50, let the basis run down to $0, donate when the share is worth $52: Your charitable deduction is $2).

You’d be better off donating appreciated shares of Exxon; provided you’ve held them more than a year, you will get a deduction for their current market value and the appreciation is never taxed.”

I admittingly don’t understand the logic used in that article.",thygah,8,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/thygah/mlps_and_charitable_giving/

2026,Thoughts on EPAM (Epam Systems) stock?,,"(**tldr** \- excellent tech company with excellent financials + lots of Eastern European offices crashed, is now picking up steam again. Is this a golden opportunity to buy them cheap, or should I stay away?)

EPAM Systems is an American tech company that specializes in product development, digital platform engineering, and digital product design. Their financials look pretty solid:

* Revenue and net income growing year over year
* Total liabilities only \~29% the value of their total assets
* A good ROE

There's just one problem: they have (had) a lot of offices in Eastern Europe, and predictably, **their stock lost about half of its value when Russia invaded Ukraine**. [They have joined the sanctions against Russia,](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3809843-epam-systems-rallies-behind-employees-caught-in-the-deeply-personal-ukrainian-war) and it's not clear when (or if) they'll get their Ukrainian workforce back.

But in the past 5 days, their stock has regained a lot (+25%). Don't forget that they are still an American company, and they have also announced ""business continuity plans"" (i.e. hiring a bunch of people elsewhere in the world).

Do they have a chance of continuing to rebound? Is this a great chance to snatch up an excellent company/stock at a low price? Or are global companies with their hands in Eastern Europe basically done (for the foreseeable future), and should be avoided at all costs for now?

2028,Frencken Group Limited (SGX: Singapore) DD,Company Discussion,"[Frencken](http://frenckengroup.listedcompany.com/) designs and manufactures systems for Original Equipment Manufacturers in the analytical & life sciences, healthcare, semiconductor and industrial automation markets, and offers contract design and manufacturing services to the automotive and consumer & industrial electronics segments.

**What?**

Think interior plastic decorative parts for cars, components for a patient table, micro motors for heart implants, water fabrication equipment for semiconductors, components for industrial automation, and so on. 

They operate 18 sites with about 4.000 employees in Europe, Asia and the US, and serve customers in more than 50 countries. Google reviews of their sites in Europe by employees are positive.

**Magic numbers in Singapore Dollars (S$)**

 In FY2021, the Group’s revenue increased 23.6% year-on-year (yoy) to reach a record S$767 million. The Mechatronics Division posted a 26.6% increase in revenue to S$659.0 million due to the growth of the semiconductor segment.  Revenue at the IMS Division increased 6.8% to S$107.8 million because demand from automotive customers was constrained during the second half of the year due to semiconductor chip supply chain challenges.

*  Shareholders’ equity increased to S$376.2 million, which is equivalent to a net asset value of 88 cents per share (current share price of S$1.55 is assets minus debts x 2)
* S$688M assets and S$309M liabilities
* Revenue up from 2019, discounting 2020, by 16%
* Profit up from 2019, discounting 2020, by 22%
* EPS up from 2019, discounting 2020, by 38%
* PE of 11
* Net profit on turnover is 7.7%

They acquired Avimac which already has an established customer base, certified manufacturing facilities and programs in the commercial aerospace engineering industry and cooperation with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. They acquired a controlling equity interest in Penchem Technologies that produces polymer materials.

**So?**

It is down from its ATH since Nov 21, so it could be a good recovery play in the semiconductor/automotive industry, and a good play for industrial automation, away from the overvalued US market.

Here are details I remember:

* This company started in the 1980's when 2 guys (possibly 1 was a mathematician?) realized that their price prediction models ***based on technical analysis*** could accurately predict future price movements 
* The company was modestly successful at the beginning but they reinvested their profits into hiring geniuses at math & computer science who all signed NDA's and worked for the financial company to make the models even better which led to huge profits 
* The yearly rates of return were consistently in the 50% - 200% range for at least a dozen years 
* The company was so successful that they kicked out all their investors and fired all their clients and became only available for the investing benefit of its own employees/owners



The financial firm may have possibly been Blackstone Inc. or BlackRock Inc. but the wikipedia pages don't seem to be 100% in agreement with the things about the company as told by the youtube video. **Can anyone tell me the name of the financial firm so I have a better chance of finding the documentary I watched?**

2040,Very high borrow rates for multifactor ETFs - why?,,"Borrow rates for most large, liquid, diversified ETFs are quite low.

As of the writing of this post and per [iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com),

[SPY](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/SPY) (S&P 500), [EFA](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/EFA) (MSCI EAFE), [EEM](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/EEM) (MSCI Emerging Markets), [QQQ](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/QQQ) (Nasdaq 100) borrow rates are all below 1%.

ETFs tracking certain asset classes that are harder to short for retail investors/investors who can't trade OTC have moderately higher borrow fees, like [JNK](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/JNK) (HY bonds) at 3%.

However, many factor ETFs, especially multifactor funds, have extraordinarily high borrow rates, especially vs their relatively modest tracking errors. Examples include [LRGF](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/LRGF) (MSCI USA Multifactor) at 21%, [VFMF](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/VFMF) (Vanguard US Multifactor fund) at 31% and [SMLF](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/SMLF) (MSCI USA Small Cap Multifactor) at a whopping 122%. Other factor funds, particularly value, also have relatively high borrow rates (DFAT, AVUV, IVAL for example). Many active funds are expensive to short too ie [FMAG](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/FMAG) (Fidelity Magellan) at 11%.

What gives? This doesn't seem to be a particularly new phenomenon, and even though borrow fees aren't fully passed on to longs + not all units can be lent out, wouldn't it be attractive to hold many of these ETFs simply to receive (a portion of) the borrow fees?

I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels.

Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

Is it just a coincidence all these events are happening at the same time?

Cruise:

1. owned by GM (100%?) so to invest in Cruise I would have to buy GM stock?
2. from my search, it seems like Cruise can still IPO in the future. Would they get their own ticker symbol separate from GM (assuming answer to question 1 is yes)
3. I don’t understand how Cruise can IPO even though they’re (fully owned?) by GM. It’s like Instagram or LinkedIn going through a IPO

Waymo:

1. It seems Waymo is described as a subsidiary of Google. Struggling to understand how this is different from the Cruise/GM situation
2. If I buy Google stock, am I also investing in Waymo
3. Can Waymo IPO in the future
4. If Waymo IPO (assuming answer to 3. Is yes) would they have their own ticker symbol independed of Google?

Activision Blizzard

1. When they’re acquired, will their situation be more like Waymo or Cruise?

Example: Let’s look at an index fund for which you paid $10,000, assuming it earns 10% per year:

* Year 0: $10,000
* End of Year 1: $10,000 + (10% x $10,000) = $11,000

2056,The most important thing in trading is having the right mindset,,"Hey guys,

**This post is only about the mindset not how to pick the right stock, value investing etc.** 

For me the most important thing in trading is having the right mindset. 

\- I have a group of friends and we talk about stocks a lot, and we all have the exact same knowledgebut still we have very different results.

\- My step-father know nearly nothing about stocks but still he makes good profit

How come ?

**Know your risk and stay in your zone:**

If you buy a risky stock be prepared for big winnings but also more important for big loses. I have friend who called me at night who said that he can’t handle it anymore because his portfolio is -30% down and sold everything..... I saw it in the forum here as well.

If you buy a stock long-term and it dips after 2-3 years and you are unphased by it ! Congratulation !

**Long-term thinking:**

We are all greedy to some extent and want to make money quick! More trading will not make you faster rich. The right decisions will do!

**Trading is 95% of the time reading and 5% executing** not the other way around! I saw enough people who nearly trade their stocks weekly and jump from one to another. I have friend who called me and said he wants to make 1k a month with 2-3 trades a week and how is it possible to achieve...

**Gambling:**

I like to gamble with friends, but I always have a set limit of 20€-30€. My goal is having max fun and not winnings!

With trading I want the opposite, max money and not max fun therefore **I don’t gamble when I trade!**

There are people who gamble and won a lot of money, short term with options/future but this is gambling it’s like winning the lottery you need luck no skill. Stay away from it.

If you have a  gambling mindset, trading is not for you!

&#x200B;

**Its money:**

Don’t forget, it’s real money and probably your life savings! Never lose the feeling of it. It is very easy especially with day trading to lose the feeling for it and go full yolo into it.

&#x200B;

If you always brooke and have always depts watch out ! Get your finance stuff together first!

&#x200B;

**Emotions:**

Emotions and trading don’t go well together. You buy a stock because you believe you make money with it not because elon musk is really cute and driving a tesla is cool.

**Role Models:**

Always look up at people who are in the long-term more successful than you are. If you want to be like Jordan Belfort (The guy from Wolf of Wallstreet) I have bad news for you. He was a scum who ripped of people there is nothing to admire about this guy. I liked the movie tho.

Pick the right ones! These can even be your parents or someone you know!

**Goals:**

Having goals is important! Why are you doing it? My goal is to retire one day and have some good money left. If you want to drive a lambo in the next 2 years. ehm again I have bad news for you...

&#x200B;

**Summary  :**

&#x200B;

\- Know your risk

\- Invest dont gamble

\- Never lose the feeling of money

\- No emotions

\- Think (a lot) before you act

\- Set goals

\- Choose the role model

\- Be patient

If you want to add something or ask, feel free !

2058,Bond ETFs look like a great opportunity.,,"Many people are talking about how bonds are a terrible investment right now, but looking at the NAV drops on bond etfs make it seem like these are great long-term opportunities. I'm still very new to this so I'm hoping someone smarter than me can explain why my thinking is wrong.

&nbsp;

**Increasing rates causes decreasing bond prices**

New treasury bonds are giving better interest rates so it obviously makes sense, for right now, to park money here instead of the lower interest existing bonds. The value of the existing bonds drop until the existing coupon payments *roughly* translate to the same yield as the newer treasuries.

&nbsp;

**Bond ETFs eventually catch up**

So with an etf like BND where the average duration is ~6 years, that means the older bonds are routinely getting removed while the newer (and higher yielding) bonds are coming in. Eventually, BND's dividend will start to increase (from higher coupons). This should also mean that BND's NAV price would start to increase alongside the increased dividends.

&nbsp;

A super basic formula would be:

    P(BND) * Div(BND) = Y(BND) = Y(NT)
   

&nbsp;

*where Y(NT) is yield of new treasuries, P(BND) is the BND etf NAV, Div(BND) is the current BND dividend/coupon, and Y(BND) is the current BND yield*

&nbsp;

**Interest rate increases are already baked in**

So with BND, when the yield of new treasuries goes up (*Y(NT)*) then an efficient market will ensure BND's yield matches that. I could put $100 towards new treasuries and earn 2.5% yield or put $100 towards BND earning a 2.0% dividend. I'd obviously choose the former and therefore the market responds by lowering the BND price to $80. Now I can buy roughly 1.2 shares of the BND etf (with my $100) with a 2.0% dividend, which gives me a total 2.5% yield.


Knowing what I just stated above, **I'd obviously buy the discounted BND price** because I know those higher coupon treasuries will make it into the etf and increase dividends. If the Fed keeps interest rates steady, then 6 years later the BND etf will hold all treasuries with that newer interest rate and return 2.5% dividends. This pushes the NAV back up to $100. When people say existing bonds and etfs like BNDs will drop further due to interest rate hikes, wouldn't the market already be taking that into account? I assume it would be and therefore the decrease in NAV will eventually reverse long term.

&nbsp;

**Conclusion** 

Bond etfs lag behind on their relative yield when interest rates increase, but for long term investing you can buy the discounted NAV price knowing that eventually the interest rates will stop increasing. You get a double benefit: increased dividends over time and increased NAV. 

I'm likely very misinformed or making bad assumptions. Sometimes when I see comments talk about how bonds are, there is this natural inclination to think *so this must mean it's a good time to buy*.",ttfay9,7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ttfay9/bond_etfs_look_like_a_great_opportunity/
2059,Qualified dividends when DCAing?,Advice Request,"My understanding is that qualified dividends are when you've held the stock (or ETF) for 60 or more days, and non-qualified dividends are when you've held the stock for less than 60 days. Qualified dividends, of course, are taxed at the capital gains rate, whereas non-qualified dividends are taxed at the income rate. Thus, qualified dividends are preferred. This is the best way I can explain it without writing a novel.

What, then, if some of my shares of stock (or ETF) are held for more than 60 days, while some are held for less? This could easily happen if you're DCAing. Do my dividends (or fund distributions, if ETF) get taxed as qualified dividends, or non-qualified dividends? Or is it split between qualified and non-qualified, based on how much of each I have??? I'm sure I am overthinking this, but I guess I'm trying to figure out the implications.

I hope my question makes sense.

2060,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 31, 2022",Recap/Watchlist,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 31, 2022**

Stocks fell on Thursday to close out the worst quarter in two years as market participants continue to digest developments out of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and President Biden’s decision to carry out the largest release of oil from the US’ reserve in an effort to fight spiking energy prices. The price of crude oil fell roughly -6.50% in response to hover just over $100 a barrel. 

**Markets Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.54%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.24%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.50%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.06%

* Shopify (SHOP): -4.20%
* UiPath (PATH): -25.62%
* Nio (NIO): -5.05%
* Didi Global (DIDI): -14.97%

President Biden unveiled plans to release 1 million barrels of oil a day starting May for the next six months. This is the largest release of reserve petroleum ever in an effort to fight spiking energy prices. Oil spiked to as high as $130 earlier in the month, leading to record prices at the pumps.

President Biden said, “This is a moment of consequence and peril for the world, and pain at the pump for American families. Our prices are rising because of Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions,"" he said. There isn't enough supply. And the bottom line is if we want lower gas prices we need to have more oil supply right now.” While this is not entirely true (the price of oil had been rising even before), the price of oil dramatically spiked following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. 

Meanwhile, Russia forces have continued attacks on Kyiv, Mariupol, and other northern Ukrainian cities despite reports that Moscow was planning to scale back military operations during peace talks in Istanbul. However, US and other officials were skeptical of reports. President Joe Biden said that he won’t “read anything” to the claims “until I see what their actions are.” Biden said the U.S. has no plans to withdraw sanctions or military aid to Ukraine. 

Stocks have had a turbulent start to the year as a number of headwinds — geopolitical turmoil, rising inflation, supply chain imbalances, and central bank monetary tightening - sparking a sell-off in the market. Still, the S&P 500 is up 11% from its lowest level of the year in early March as of Tuesday’s close and just 4% shy of notching a new all-time high after a recent comeback.

“The good news is stocks really appear to love April,” LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick said in a note, pointing out the month has closed green every year since 2006 except for 2012. “Not only is it the best month on average since 1950, but it has also been higher an incredible 15 of the past 16 years as well.”

Despite the recent rally, the market continues to face a number of headwinds. Investors are nervously eyeing a flattening yield curve, with longer-duration bonds yields falling below shorter-term term yields. 

The spread, or difference, between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury note yields narrowed to its lowest level since 2019 earlier this week and briefly inverted on Tuesday. [A yield curve inversion has a history of predicting a recession](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/yield-curve.asp#:~:text=The%20slope%20of%20the%20yield,about%20economic%20activity%20and%20inflation.), with each of the last eight recessions dating back to 1969 preceded by a yield curve inversion.

Moreover, the US is facing the fastest pace of inflation in 40 years as excess capital, supply-chain bottlenecks, and rising commodity prices cause the price of goods across the board to rise, with February consumer price index rising to 7.9% year-over-year. Unfortunately, March CPI numbers (due April 12), are likely to be worse as the spike in energy and other commodities is priced in. 

The Labor Department’s [weekly jobless claims out Thursday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weekly-jobless-claims-week-ended-march-26-2022-192349945.html) show initial unemployment claims ticked up slightly to 202,000 after setting a 50-year low. Economists had forecast a reading of 196,000, according to Bloomberg data.

In its monthly private payroll report, [ADP reports payrolls rose by 455,000.](https://adpemploymentreport.com/2022/March/NER/docs/ADP-NATIONAL-EMPLOYMENT-REPORT-March2022-Final-Press-Release.pdf) Consensus economists were looking for 450,000 jobs to return, according to Bloomberg data. In February, employers brought back 486,000 payrolls, based on ADP's upwardly revised monthly print.

More jobs data is underway this week, including the all important monthly unemployment report for March on Friday, expected to show another robust reading of 490,000 payrolls added, per Bloomberg economist estimates.

On Friday, the US and allies levied new sanctions against Russia in response to its unwarranted invasion of Ukraine. The new sanctions target hundreds of members of the Russian parliament and the CEO of the largest bank in the country. Most significantly, the US Department of the Treasury warned that any gold-related transactions involving Russia may be sanctionable by US authorities. 

A senior administrator at the Treasury said, “Our purpose here is to methodically remove the benefits and privileges Russia once enjoyed as a participant in the international economic order.” As a reminder, Russia has already been expelled from the SWIFT international payment system, which essentially freezes banks from sending or receiving transactions. The move comes as President Joe Biden and NATO allies convene in Brussels for a series of summits to discuss the conflict.

In the US, the Federal Reserve has the inevitable task of reigning in the fastest pace of inflation in over forty years without tanking the economy and plunging us into a recession. To that end, last week, the Federal Reserve raised the interest by 0.25% from near-zero levels for the first time since 2018 and committed to shrinking the balance sheet.

He said the Fed was ready to “take necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability. In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

Later this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the March job report, which will give a clearer picture of the state of the labor market in the US. Labor market tightness is a strong influence on the Fed's decision to begin tightening monetary policy, with historically low levels of unemployment coupled with a record number of job openings suggesting the economy is strong enough to absorb these hikes. The report is likely to show another robust reading with payrolls expected to rise by 490,000, according to Bloomberg economist estimates.

Christopher Rupkey, Chief Economist at FWDBONDS, said “The payroll jobs report could be the biggest one yet in this recovery from the pandemic. “Federal Reserve officials are already chomping at the bit for bigger 50 bps rate hikes at upcoming meetings, and the tightest labor market since the 1960s is like pouring gasoline on the fire were any policy official worth his or her salt is burning with desire to get interest rates up to 2% neutral levels now. 

In other economic news,  is a fresh read on the monthly personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator due out Thursday. The gauge is another indicator of how quickly prices are increasing across the country. Consensus economists expect the PCE to post a rise of another 0.6% in February, according to Bloomberg data. Core PCE, which is the measure the Fed uses to conduct monetary policy, is also expected to show a 0.3% month-over-month increase to 5.5%.

2069,Options contracts after a split.. what happens?,,"I'm going to use Amazon as an example here since it'll be splitting at the end of May. (20:1 split)

&#x200B;

Say I buy a call option tomorrow with $4000 strike that ends in July. The split will have happened and I know the Options Clearing House will come in and readjust my strike price based on the new numbers. So my $4000 strike price would become $200 post split.  


My big question is would I get more contracts to make up for the difference as well since it's 20:1 split? My 100 potential shares for that option contract would then become 2000 potential shares during the split so for it to be adjusted correctly, they would have to adjust the amount of contracts as well, right?

Or would it still be 1:1 and I would just eat a healthy premium?

2077,Should I hold strong currency with weaker interest rate or a weaker currency with high interest rate?,,"I earn in USD but my home country has a different currency INR. 

Pros of holding USD:

1. Converting to INR cost me 0.5% of the amount which I save by not converting.

2. USD/INR rate seems to be going up for decades.

3. More stable currency.

Pros of holding INR:

1. Higher interest rate by bank/govt but there is also taxation on interest.

Let's assume the interest rate is consistent. Also, assume 0.5% is a fixed charge and will remain the same forever. Let's ignore geographical risk.

Now, I want to calculate which is more attractive currency. Our variables are:

1. 0.5% fees (straight-forward)

2. Income taxation on interests on deposit (straight-forward too)

3. USD/INR exchange rate improvement over the years (how do I find the statistical mathematical value?)

Assuming I don't need the money anytime soon or want to invest in stocks, how do I put all these 3 variables in an equation to find more attractive currency?

2078,Nvidia Investor Day - are expectations too high ?,Discussion,"Here are the main discussion points for Nvidia's investor day (and my expectations):

1. New chips: Hopper (data center), Bluefield data processing (DPU) and Grace (CPU). *EXPECT UPSIDE SURPRISE*
2. Data center addressable market update - previously highlighted as a $100bn opportunity. E*XPECT UPSIDE SURPRISE*
3. Software/subscription opportunity across enterprise AI, metaverse, autos and gaming; *POTENTIAL FOR DOWNSIDE SURPEISE AS STILL TOO EARLY FOR COMPANY TO PROVIDE DETAILS?*
4. Automotive pipeline details - previously $8bn - *TOO FAR OUT TO MATTER?*
5. Buybacks following no Arm deal. *MAY PROVIDE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION*

I think there is potential for upside from the data center side - new products and large data center opportunity. AI has really gained broad adoption beyond consumer use e.g. powering ""next gen"" cybersecurity solutions, companies are deploying AI based sales lead generation, procurement tools etc. This should be significant benefit for Nvidia and I think it is already in motion so they should be providing an update.

On the flip side I think its too early to provide concrete numbers re Omniverse, Nvidia's version of industrial metaverse, which may be a downside surprise for some investors.

Or should we actually view them as ownership, and the point of having money invested is to increase our position in companies we like and have more of a vote?

Founded in 2014. NIU designs, manufactures and sells high-performance electric scooters, motorcycles, bicycles and kick-scooters.

*Demand*: Scooters are a very convenient means of traveling. Anyone who has been to SE Asia has definitely noticed that the place is packed with scooters. These scooters start to be replaced with electric ones. Scooters are also popular in other regions of the world, notably Latin America, Europe and Africa.  

*Supply*: The company has doubled its production capacity last year. And now it's about 2 mln units/year. NIU has developed a rich network of stores around the world (3108 in China alone).  
NIU has several competitors, but has a few advantages over them. Mainly it benefits from lower labor costs.  


**Financials**

For a young company, NIU has a strong balance sheet. Positive Net Income and Cash Flow. The company does not need to issue new shares to finance its CAPEX.   
It benefits from access to cheap funding as China has been easing its monetary policy. They can afford to do that as the latest inflation figure was 0.9% in China.

In 2021 revenues were up almost 52%. At about $581mln, slightly more than the current Market Cap (P/S ratio > 1, rare thing).

Nevertheless, the price went down during the latest few months because of all-out war concerns but also because Q4 & Q1 are traditionally soft quarters, due to weather. Gross margin slightly lower reflecting higher commodity and shipping costs. Which are expected to fall onward. 

This year the sales are estimated to go up roughly 40%.   


**Valuation**

52 week high of $44/share, low of $7.50.  

All the analysts polled by Yahoo Finance, have a BUY/STRONG BUY stance. 

The average PT is $36.

Latest coverage, comes from Citigroup, it placed a price target of $35, which implies a roughly 300% upside potential.

Downside perceived as being somewhat limited as China vowed to support the market a few days ago.",th1czt,6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/th1czt/niu_technologies_niu_overview/

2090,Recharacterization and backdoor roth,,"My spouse and I put in 6000 each into Roth IRA accounts in 2021. However, it turns out our MAGI is above the limit, so we need to recharacterize.  I'm thinking we can recharacterize and then convert to Roth.  Is that correct?  One issue is that I have money in a rollover IRA, about $5000.  I can pay taxes for conversion out of cash.

Does this make sense to do? Would the following be the correct steps?:

1. File recharacterization form to change the 2021 Roth -> traditional IRA (do I also need to calculate how much what each of the 6000 is now worth since has been invested for the past 10 months or so?, we also have funds from earlier years)
2. Move this money back into the Roth accounts
3. For me, actually move ALL of my traditional IRA into the Roth (\~12,000)
4. Use the 8606 form to report this and figure out the tax on the \~1\`2000 for me and separate 8606 for the 6000(plus growth) for spouse.  Don't need to worry about pro-rata since I would be converting everything.

I’ve been thinking about TIPS (treasury inflation protected securities). I don’t understand exactly how they work though. It seems like they are currently paying 7.5% interest annually. With inflation rising to 8.5%, I assume they will now be at 8.5%. Am I missing something? I would be more than happy with 8.5% in the market right now. Why not just get the guaranteed 8.5% from the TIPS. I understand that I’m technically breaking even due to inflation, but I think I’m ok with that for the short term.

2104,WBD and T spinoff/merger cost basis,Advice Request,"So, personally, when calculating my cost basis (for personal reasons, not tax) I consider a spinoff as ""a removal from total cost basis of original company"". i.e since the spinoff was 0.24 shares per 1 share, my cost basis for T is reduced by the calculated cost basis of the new stock.

But, in this case, Interactive Brokers gave me stocks of Warner Bros Discovery (with a ticker symbol WBD) and priced it at the price of WBDWV. Excel cannot find WBDWV ticker symbol and WBD ticker symbol leads to WeBuild (and even half the articles in financial websites show WBD and the other half show WBDWV).  


The way I would calculate spinoffs in the past (e.g. OGN, ONL, KD etc) would be.   
I received X shares of new company, multiplied by IPO price, that's the cost basis of the new shares I received, and that amount is removed from Original Company. Since my original purchase, is now divided into two companies at X and Y percentages, so does my cost basis.   
Some people told me that's wrong, the new company is ""free"" and my cost basis on the original should not change, I disagree completely on that, but that's for my personal calculations, not for any tax purposes (I live in a country with no capital gains tax so it doesn't really matter).

&#x200B;

Now, to the question, what should I consider as ""IPO"" price for Warner Bros Discovery? Also, Which ticker symbol should I use? This is confusing.

2113,Thoughts on Floating Rate Funds in the current atmosphere?,,"Hello r/investing!

My girlfriend and I have a few thousand shares of RSFYX (Victory Floating Rate Fund) through Raymond James -- our average share cost is $9.17 (current price is $9.16).

The price of RSFYX has been on a steady decline since its inception, though it pays decent monthly dividends, and we only pay 1.25% our portfolio value to Raymond James in fees annually (about 0.3% each quarter). We were up 2ish% right before the crazy geopolitical news broke. Since then, we were down 2% at one point, but now only down 0.6% (mainly from fees, as our average share price is $0.01 below the current share price).

The reason I am typing this post is because we are under contract for a new-construction townhome that will break ground in a few weeks. We plan to hold (and continue buying with regular contributions) until we need to sell shares for our down payment, closing costs, and other associated fees. This may be sometime in the next 12-18 months.

Essentially 99% of our saved money is held in these RSFYX shares - emergency fund, new home, furniture, etc. My girlfriend and I share the mentality that although we are taking a slight/safe(?) risk, this savings method is likely to generate better returns than a typical savings account. I am not anxious by any means, but I am curious to hear the community's thoughts on this strategy, especially during this volatility. I watch the RSFYX price daily, it typically never fluctuates more than a couple cents. When the war in the east broke out, it did react rather dramatically compared to its usual behavior, and has been on a slow climb back up since.

Do you think we are better off holding a portion (or all) of this money in cash for the next year and half (or more)? How could the general performance of the economy or Fed interest rate hikes over the next year affect the bank loan interest that floating rate funds deal with? What are your thoughts on floating rate funds in general, and using them as a vehicle for saving money that typically makes decent gains in the long run?

2114,Do market orders only get filled IF there is a buy and a sell market order?,Trades,"Let's say the market has 3 people trading for a company's stock.  

Person one bidding $10, person two asking $11, and person 3 buying at market price. 

How will the market order buy get filled? 


Now, let's say 4 people: 
Person one bidding $10, person two asking $11, and person 3 buying at market price, Person four selling at market price. 

The broker will collect $11 from person 3, and give person 4 $10, and pocket the $1. And will move the stock from person four to person three.  Is my understanding correct?

Now, for persons 1 and 2, their orders will never get filled unless buyer increased his bid or seller reduced his ask. Correct?",txx7tq,6,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/txx7tq/do_market_orders_only_get_filled_if_there_is_a/

# [Stock futures fall for a second day as rates jump with the Fed set to tighten policy aggressively](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/05/stock-futures-inch-higher-ahead-of-fed-minutes-release.html)

*****
> Stock futures dipped for a second day on Wednesday and rates soared to new heights as investors bet the Federal Reserve is about to aggressively tighten policy to fight inflation, and in turn slow the economy.
*****
> Minutes from the Fed’s most-recent meeting are slated for release Wednesday afternoon. The minutes come from last month’s meeting when the central bank raised rates and indicated six more hikes were coming this year. Investors are bracing for new details about the Fed’s plan to reduce its balance sheet after comments from Fed officials knocked down stocks on Tuesday.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 220 points, or 0.65% on Wednesday. S&P 500 futures were down 0.9%, and Nasdaq-100 index futures shed 1.5%. All three major averages were headed for their second day of declines.
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 2.65% on Wednesday, hitting a three-year high and continuing its rapid climb this week. The rate ended Monday at 2.40%.
*****
> Fed Governor Lael Brainard in a speech on Tuesday indicated support for higher interest rates and said a “rapid” reduction of the central bank’s balance sheet could begin as soon as May. Following her remarks, the Dow pulled back by about 280 points and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.3%.
*****
> “It is of paramount importance to get inflation down,” Brainard said during a Minneapolis Fed webinar. Brainard has been nominated to be vice chair of the Federal Open Market Committee.
*****
> San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also shared concerns about inflation. “I understand that inflation is as harmful as not having a job,” Daly said.
*****
> Tech shares led Tuesday’s losses and were set to fall again on Wednesday as investors rotated out of the group and braced for higher rates to slow the economy. Chipmakers suffered some of the biggest declines, with Nvidia and Marvell Technology falling more than 5% and 6%, respectively. Both companies were set to continue their descent on Wednesday.
*****
> Tesla, Microsoft, and Amazon shares were also slated to fall more than 2% on Wednesday and Twitter shed 3% premarket after rallying this week amid news that Elon Musk purchased a large stake in the company. As the Federal Reserve hikes rates investors have begun rotating into stocks with stable profits, shying away from those offering future growth.
*****
> Investors continued to monitor the latest developments out of Europe, as the Ukraine-Russia war continues. The European Union and the U.S. are preparing to slap new sanctions on Russia after evidence emerged of war crimes allegedly committed by Russian forces. The new sanctions include a ban on Russian coal imports. (Click here for the latest.)
*****
> Crude prices, which have been volatile since the war began, rose again on Wednesday after dipping Tuesday. U.S. oil prices were up by 1.1% at $103.09 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent gained about 1%% to trade at $107.66 per barrel.

2116,What order should I learn things?,Newbie,"I remember when I got into music producing and wanted to start producing through a digital audio workstation (DAW)
 
 I started learning the basics on how to use the software but when I got further into learning I didn’t know which order to learn how to produce music, I would often skip to more complex things before I would even learn some basic things.

I do not want to make this mistake with investing, I have learned the basics and have read a few books but now I don’t wanna try to learn complex things before I can even learn other basics.

When I did this with music production I often found myself confused with even the smallest simplest problems and got in a twisted circle of trying to find out the order of things I should learn before moving on to something else.

EXAMPLE: Trying to learn options before you understand what a bid/ask price is.

[Breakdown of Ratios](https://youtu.be/Jkse-Wafe9U)

Around 53:00 into that link. Starts a minute prior but this question is covered regardless around 53 minutes. Professor Webb and a student of his agree that the Book Value = **Total Equity** divided by shares outstanding. (His specific words are ""by the number of shares"" which I'm assuming means shares outstanding given the complete lecture) The issue is when I fact check (I check what I'm learning as I go along) through web search for Book Value. I get Book Value = Total Assets divided by shares. Two different equations. I've even seen someone answer **CURRENT** Assets divided by shares.

I'm hoping the more experienced here can provide insight on this one.

SoftBank Liquidates Most of Portfolio at ‘Nasdaq Whale’ Unit: FT

April 2, 2022, 7:47 AM EDT
SoftBank has closed most of its positions in the internal hedge fund SB Northstar following losses of between $6 billion and $7 billion from the so-called ‘Nasdaq whale’ trades, the Financial Times reports, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. 

Citing regulatory filings, the Financial Times reported Saturday that Northstar’s investment manager, SB Management, held a bit more than $1 billion in U.S. listed stocks at the end of 2021, down from more than $17 billion a year earlier. The majority of their European investments were also dissolved during the same period, which included a $5 billion bet on drug-maker Roche Holding AG, the person told the FT. The ‘handful’ of positions left had been transferred to SoftBank Group, FT reported.",tus04p,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tus04p/softbank_liquidates_most_of_portfolio_at_nasdaq/

So when the yield inverted today why we had a sell off at the end of the day? 
Its not that this inversion happened suddenly.
For weeks every economic journalist publish news about the upcoming inversion and what does that mean for the makers and economy. I would expect this to be fully priced in, since it is expected to happen anybof these days. 

So why stocks feel rapidly at the end of the day for something that everyone knew is coming?

Another example are Chinese stocks. Everyone knows the list of delisting. But the moment Baidu is added on the SEC list it falls 8% in one day, as this were some news that nobody expected

2131,Does Government's Forced Rothifying of Catch Up Contributions Change The Conventional Wisdom About Roth's In Your 20's?,,"As I'm sure you've heard, government seems poised to force Gen X into ""rothifying"" their 401k catch up contributions. This will raise 36 billion in revenue by not allowing people during their highest earning years to reduce their MAGI with a pre tax 401k catch up contribution. 

Simultaneously, Boomers are being allowed to punt their tax bill down the road by delaying RMD's and are getting extra catch up contributions at 62.   


Since catch up contributions are going to be corralled into a Roth in your 50's, do you think the advice about contributing to a roth in your 20's should change? Maybe it should be a more even split? Ideas around this?",tt8hye,6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tt8hye/does_governments_forced_rothifying_of_catch_up/
2132,Biden’s Global Quest for Oil Triggers Political Pushback,Industry Discussion,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-global-quest-for-oil-triggers-political-pushback-11648632601?mod=hp_lead_pos1

Republicans have criticized him for scolding the U.S. oil industry and pushing for alternative-energy sources even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has underscored the world’s dependence on fossil fuels.

Mr. Biden has shifted course recently, including announcing that the U.S. would ship more liquefied natural gas to Europe to help countries there reduce their dependence on Russian gas.

That shift, however, drove concerns among progressives who think the Democratic president is stepping back from his campaign promise to transition the U.S. away from fossil fuels. Democrats also have chafed at White House attempts to get authoritarian regimes such as Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to produce more oil.

A White House spokeswoman said Mr. Biden “wants to do everything possible and sensible to mitigate” the effect of high energy prices on American families.

“He’s been clear in recent remarks that oil and gas companies should help ensure that oil supply meets demand, and at the same time we need to advance clean energy options and decrease our reliance on fossil fuels,” the spokeswoman said.

Decade-high prices and limited spare capacity give Mr. Biden few places to turn aside from oil companies he has shunned as climate polluters and foreign producers with checkered histories, said Samantha Gross, a fellow specializing in climate and energy at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington.",tt7lzs,5,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tt7lzs/bidens_global_quest_for_oil_triggers_political/
2133,"$SGLY, is a potentially coordinated self enrichment scam.",Valuation,""" Do your own due diligence. My report is solely aimed for educational purpose.""

Note: 

My analytical process is a system that I have devised to quickly and straightforwardly ascertain the value of a business by emphasizing on a short set of "" of catalysts"" that are sufficient to glean a relative valuation of the company net worth outside of its current stock price. Price and Value do not always equate but rather merge over time. Price, to emphasize, is a variable that is affected by many externalities often unrelated to the asset true "" Value"".  It is only through a serious and systematic investigation of the asset in question that a relative clear estimation of the "" Price"" can be offered. 

&#x200B;

I am asserting that Singularity Future Technology, formerly known by as Sino Global Shipping co, is a stock gaming operation with little material business operation with the sole aim of enriching its controlling officers and related parties. 

Initially formed as an operator of logistic and shipping management services, the company has made a through 180 degree turn into crypto mining and NFT and changed its name to align with its new business model. 

But what is Singularity Future Tech real business model? 

It appears that riding speculative trends by forming "" PRE-EMPTIVELY"" papered joint ventures and subsidiaries aligned with potential speculative trends is the ONLY business model in effect. The goal here is to align the company stocks with the market trend and subsequently reward insiders with stock awards at extreme discount to current markets. 

Currently, per the 10k, the company has formed 4 subsidiaries and joint ventures unrelated to their initial business proposition. 

\-Georgous trading was registered in July 2021 for smart warehousing and related businesses.

\-Phi Electric Motor was formed in August 2021 and is non operative as of now.

\-SG shipping and risk solution for formed in October 2021, Non operative. 

\-Thor miner, the current darling; was formed in october 2021 in a strategic alliance agreement with Shenzhen high sharp electronic to establish a joint venture. The crypto mining joint venture is the recent "" focus"" of the company. Which explains the name change and the high flying stock price. 

&#x200B;

With its high flying stock price and despite its history of losses and accumulated deficits, the company executives and related parties have been handsomely rewarded through stock awards. 

""*On February 4, 2022, the Company approved a one-time award of a total of 500,000 shares of common stock from the shares reserved under the Company’s 2021 Stock Incentive Plan to certain executive officers of the Company, including Chief Executive Officer, Yang Jie (300,000 shares), COO, Jing Shan (100,000 shares), and Chief Technology Officer, Shi Qiu (100,000 shares). The total fair value of the grants amounts to approximately $2.7 million based on grant date share price of $5.48.*

*On January 19, 2022, the Board of the Company approved the issuance of 1,300,000 shares of restricted common stock to two advisory firms pursuant to consulting agreements. The scope of services primarily covers advising on business development, strategic planning and corporate finance. The fair value of the services is approximately $5.9 million to be vested when the services were completed per contract terms.""* ***note 21, 10Q.*** 

**This is merely the latest instance of the company "" approving"" one time stock awards to its officers and related parties!** 

\-The company received a notice of delisting in 2020, registered close to 12M in losses in 2021 with 3,3M stemming from its stocks based compensation alone. 

**- The company did not care to include risk factors in its last 10K.**

\-**Audit Alliance LLP, a well established auditor of Chinese scams is the company's auditor!** 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Further dwelling into the companies' valuation in unnecessary in the light of the above mentioned highlights.   What is clear however is that LGLY sole operative model consist in riding speculative trends, like the crypto mania of our day, and reward its executives and partners with low priced stocks awards primed for a profitable dump.

2142,A question about Bid and Ask effecting stock price,Discussion,"Let’s say stock XYZ has a price of 5 dollars. Person A notices there’s no ask prices on the level 2 heading into pre market. He then gets person B to help out on a little experiment.

 Person A says he’ll place a buy order for $50 for 1 share as soon as it hits 4am, person B places a sell order for $50 for one share at the exact same time.  

Considering the orders worked and person B sold a share for $50, Would stock XYZ jump to $50 due to that being the highest price the stock was traded?  

Another question, would this be illegal? Could this be considered market manipulation? Making a stock jump 1000% with one share seems impossible so that's why I've come here with this question 

Please note, this is a hypothetical scenario, I do not plan or condone attempting this. NFA

* Morningstars: ""Ross should be relatively well-insulated against digital rivals, considering its differentiated store experience and operational efficiency (which fuels its competitive prices).”
* If we go into a recession Ross should perform relatively well.

Some cons:

* Morningstars: Rising labor costs can strain margins, with asymmetric pressure relative to online rivals considering Ross' need to maintain in-store staff.

Energy and commodity prices spiked again amid the latest developments in Russia's war in Ukraine. As of Monday, Ukraine refused to surrender its heavily attacked port city of Mariupol to Russian forces. Russian forces, facing stiff resistance, have sought to gain control of major cities but have so been unsuccessful. The Kremlin says its ""special operation"" is going as planned. But a senior Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity Monday, told Reuters Russian President Vladimir Putin has not achieved his goals and is relying on bombing raids in cities like Mariupol in a “near-desperate” effort to gain momentum.

[https://www.barrons.com/news/russia-ramps-up-air-naval-activity-in-ukraine-war-pentagon-01647884707](https://www.barrons.com/news/russia-ramps-up-air-naval-activity-in-ukraine-war-pentagon-01647884707)

Last week, after two years of a near-zero interest rate and despite geopolitical uncertainties, the US Federal Reserve raised the interest rate by 0.25 basis points in order to fight the fastest pace of inflation in over 40 years. Price pressures, which initially affected a few categories most affected by the pandemic (semiconductors, automobiles, etc), are spilling over into the broader economy and the recent surge in commodity prices has further pushed out the timeline for the peak of inflation and normalization. Remember, last month’s CPI did not take into account the spike in oil, natural gas, and metal prices stemming from Russia’s war in Ukraine. It’s very likely March CPI numbers (due April 12) are going to be even worse.

Acknowledging that inflation will likely stay higher for longer, policymakers have revised their forecasts higher. Inflation (as measured by core PCE) is expected to be at 4.1% this year, up from a 2.7% projection in December. By 2023, inflation is estimated at 2.6%, up from an earlier forecast of 2.3%.

In addition to the well-telegraphed 0.25% rate hike, the Fed released its “dot plot,” which shows where individual Fed officials expect interest rates to be. The majority of Fed officials now expect seven hikes this year, four in 2023 and none for 2024. That would take the policy rate to 1.9% this year and 2.8% by the end of 2023, slightly higher than the last cycle’s peak of 2.5% in December 2018. It would also be higher than the committee’s estimate of the long-run neutral rate, suggesting policy would be slightly restrictive to growth when the Fed is done tightening.

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtable20220316.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtable20220316.htm)

Neil Shearing, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients, “The war has added to the squeeze on real incomes in advanced economies and caused a substantial tightening of financial conditions in Europe. But, for now, central banks remain focused on bringing down inflation and containing any second-round effects on wages and prices. This is, on balance, the correct judgment. While the economic outlook is unusually uncertain, the high starting point for inflation – and the likelihood that it will rise further – justifies a tightening of policy.""

In prepared remarks to the National Association for Business Economics, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his commitment to fighting inflation, which he says can jeopardize an otherwise strong economic recovery. His comments sparked off a mid-day sell-off in the market, that was quickly bought up.

Powell said, “We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability. In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

Moreover, Powell said of supply-chain disruptions, “It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain. In the meantime, as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.”

A basis point is equal to 0.01%. FOMC officials indicated that 25 basis point increases are likely at each of their remaining six meetings this year. However, markets are pricing in about a 50-50 chance the next hike, at the May meeting, could be 50 basis points.

2157,Purchasing low cap stocks,Advice Request,"General question basically just looking for anyone, maybe a whale, that particularly knows the answer.

What would happen say a company’s market cap was 150 million and I’m just some billionaire who’s fucking around and I buy 75 million worth of that stock. When that stocks normal volume is something like 4-5 million a day, this would obviously cause the price to go up. But really my question is, what would happen to the overall share price? Do I technically own a large portion of company now? Like I understand the owner and CEO would own a certain amount of different shares/options that aren’t traded or on the active market. Does the market cap then all of a sudden jump 75 million to 225 million.

Just interested in the educational side of it and say I do become a billionaire someday, if I could do this for a small company I believed in lol",tjazxe,5,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tjazxe/purchasing_low_cap_stocks/
2158,Commodity Investors Vs Tech Investors,,"I believe we are getting close to the biggest shift in money since the USA went off the Gold Standard in the 1960's.  We now live in an era where most stocks no longer pay dividends. The only way people expect their investments will make them money is that someone tomorrow will pay more for your share of Apple , Google, or Netflix today than you paid for those share yesterday.  But none of these stocks pay their shareholders dividends.  

Now, commodity investors invest in companies that either produce, mine, or grow commodities that are needed to make food, energy, or those pesky tech microchips that are in such a shortage today.  And in a world with limited resources, with every government printing money into infinity, all the sudden tech growth no longer seems that original. And owning shares of $FCX, $HAL, or $MOS which all pay dividends and also mine, pump & produce limited resources into existence no longer seems like a crazy investment, 

This is my thesis.  The greater fool thesis in stocks always going up will eventually come to an end.  It only starts when more people start to sell and fewer people want to buy.   Because as an old man once told me, that money you thought was yours is not really your money  until you leave the casino.",tj5rvr,7,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tj5rvr/commodity_investors_vs_tech_investors/

Now that many of these stocks have fallen 40, 50, 60% in the last several months, these employees have seen their ""pay"" cut to shreds and have decided to walk away. But, by walking away, it has put many of these companies into a stall. The reduction of employees to perform the tasks required is preventing some of these companies from recovering quickly.

*****
> U.S. stock futures fell Thursday morning, following back-to-back days of sharp gains, as investors digested the latest news out of Ukraine.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 100 points, or about 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The Kremlin poured cold water over reports that indicated progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, according to Bloomberg News.
*****
> On Wednesday, the Financial Time reported that both countries had made “significant progress” on a peace plan and Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. That FT report helped stocks rally for a second day Wednesday.
*****
> Wall Street was also digesting the latest moves from the Federal Reserve. The Fed hiked its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2018 and signaled six more hikes this year, spurring a relief rally in stocks.
*****
> The Fed also significantly raised its projections for rate hikes and inflation in 2022, but investors appear to have taken those aggressive changes as proof the central bank was taking the rise in prices seriously.
*****
> “The dot plot shows they’re behind the curve, and we all know they’re behind the curve, and they’re trying to fix it,” said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors. “At least they’re telling the market ‘we’re trying to fix it.’”
*****
> Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, said on “Closing Bell: Overtime” that he expected markets to rally between now and the next Fed meeting in May after selling off sharply to start the year. He pointed to recent high readings on the Cboe Volatility Index, often called Wall Street’s fear gauge, as a sign that the selling had gone far enough, at least in the near term.
*****
> “When the VIX gets above 35, I don’t care how bad the tape looks, I don’t care how bad the geopolitics look, you’re supposed to get more bullish, not more bearish. And you get an oversold bounce,” Gundlach said.
*****
> On Wednesday, the Dow rose 518.76 points, or 1.55%, for its first three-day winning streak in more than a month. It was also the Dow’s second straight day gaining more than 500 points. The S&P 500 gained 2.24%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.77%.

Sell ITM CC for $95 for the end of next week and take a premium of $750 (and allow it to exercise)

2172,How could any other region outperform US stocks in the next 10 years?,,"I know right now everyone will predict that US stocks will outperform, because they did in recent years. And that past performance doesn’t have to repeat. 

But I’m not sure how any other region could possibly outdo US stocks in the coming years? China doesn’t seem interested in protecting shareholders like the USA is. After this recent plunge, are foreign investors really going to pour money back into China? The government has shown very clearly they do not care to protect company profits. 

Then we have Europe which has its own problems. I think there are some promising companies and countries there (like the Netherlands) but overall economic growth is below the USA, so I don’t see a big advantage. 

The only other region I could see being competitive is SEA, but I’m not very familiar with that environment and if the stock markets there are meaningful enough. But there’s been lots of American investment into private SEA companies lately so I believe there might be a push to promote IPOs abroad. 

What are your thoughts? Will the US be the best performer again in the next 10 years, or will we get a surprise (like we often do)?",tes06h,4,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tes06h/how_could_any_other_region_outperform_us_stocks/

2174,Why Big Tech still hasn’t been fully priced-in yet even at recent all time highs.,Valuation,"1. The most common cited threat for big tech is **regulatory risk**. However it’s current valuation, even at all time time highs, does not justify concern. Regulatory intervention may force big tech to abandon their best option(s), but their second-best option(s) are not often significantly worse. Take for example the big EU regulation eliminating the ability for the Android OS to default to Google search, which only slowed Google's revenue growth in EMEA by 2%. Also let’s be realistic, the United States doesn’t not want to risk destroying their best companies. The US is proud of companies like Microsoft and Apple, whom have become beacons of our capital markets and whom help us compete with growing countries like China. I foresee the US government doing some political positioning and *saying* they're against big tech, but extreme regulations would handicap a lot of the GDP, tax revenue, and wealth that helps us compete on the global scale. The fact remains that these companies will easily pivot around any and all regulations, and they will still be able to aggregate most of the market demand, and leverage that initial demand to attract ever more incremental demand.
2. This level of **aggregation** has never been seen before. For most 20th century products, distribution was controlled by the manufacturer (think Ford dealerships and Apple Stores), but that changes with the internet. Suddenly, you have intermediaries like Amazon that wield a lot of their power by controlling the supply of consumers. Now producers are competing just to get on Amazon’s front page since that’s where all of the customers are. The advertising market went from thousands of then “wide-moat” TV stations, radio stations, and newspapers globally to evolving with now over half of the demand aggregated by Google, Facebook, and Amazon alone. In general terms, it’s not that different from a department store like Macy’s, but aggregation is happening on a scale that those earlier companies could never achieve. There was much more competition back then (i.e., fewer winner-takes-most outcomes), and without the internet, the largest companies in a given industry weren’t able to aggregate demand *to the same extent* these current aggregators are able to, and I believe the market is still in the early stages of this realization.
3. This leads me to my third point, which is how the **5% rule** contributes to the systemic undervaluation of big tech and gives us retail investors and HNWIs have a significant advantage. Back in the 1940s, the SEC placed a 5% ""soft cap"" on the maximum position size for hedge funds which is still in effect today, 60 years later. Hedge funds are constrained by these fiduciary responsibilities built on data and realities of the pre-internet world where these internet-enabled aggregators did not yet exist. Even though Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google are some of the most well-researched stocks, the market hasn't priced in this new market landscape. As demand fundamentally shifts from companies operating in the “middle of the pack” to a few truly scaled winners, portfolios underexposed to big tech will have inferior risk-reward profiles to those that aren't.
4. Yet that begs the question of **concentration risk**, is being overweight in Big Tech internet-era aggregators a bad thing? Well they have vastly lower competition risk compared to “aggregators” of the pre-Internet era and much less-dominant modern companies, so in my opinion no. For example, with two or more successful aggregators within the same industry (e.g., streaming services), they're not always directly competing head-on, but rather offering complementary products and/or focusing on fulfilling different demand types (e.g., Netflix and Disney+). As a result, the concentration risk is not nearly as high nowadays as history would suggest when taking a large position in a winning aggregator/platform. Calculated diversification is good… but diversification for the sake of diversification is unnecessary with Big Tech. If anything, valuation risk is much more considerable than company-specific risk. However, at this specific moment in time the valuation risk for Big Tech is currently quite low.

The market is naturally moving toward having fewer, larger and more durable quality companies, and regulation is not going to stop that. It might cause Big Tech’s earnings growth to slow somewhat, but it just won’t alter their overall business prospects as much as most investors think it will. Big Tech has very little competition and incrementally increasing demand, and the constraints imposed by the 5% rule for hedge funds give us retail investors a leg up when it comes to structuring our portfolios.",teqr2u,7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/teqr2u/why_big_tech_still_hasnt_been_fully_pricedin_yet/

2176,Lessons Learned,,"I have been ""investing"" for a few years now and every theory I've had has been proven wrong at some point; except one. 

~~For the low price of $6.99/month we'll send this theory straight to your inbox!~~

It's that when I'm scared and everyone around me is saying ""this is the end"" or ""market about to collapse""....  It ALWAYS follows with me saying/thinking my classic phrase: ""I should have bought more."" It happens EVERY time. Right now it feels like I'm more scared than ever. My portfolio is down like 60% since the inflation FUD started... And right now, I don't know if it will ever come back...

I briefly touched $1m (intraday) in Nov 2021 and now I'm barely hanging on to 450k... I've stopped all buying activity because I'm scared that if I buy something, I will dip under 400k and never be able to claw back. I can't bring myself to risk anymore because I'm not willing to lose anymore....

I know this is not the place to look for reassurance that the market will come back because it's all bears these days, but logically speaking, isn't the best time to buy when everyone else is calling for red days? I myself am expecting more red days ahead and I'm basically a permabull... 

Any bulls out there want to talk me back to the winning side? I just feel too emotional about potentially losing more money when everyone is saying the market is inflated and I should sell everything.",u2rb9s,2,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u2rb9s/lessons_learned/

2180,Morgan Stanley Turns Cautious on Tech Hardware Stocks,Industry News,"Citing concerns about a potential slowdown in corporate IT spending, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall has turned wary on telecom and networking stocks. In a Tuesday research note, she lowered her ratings on Hewlett Packard Enterprise, F5, and NetApp. She now rates HP Enterprise (ticker: HPE) at Underweight, down from Equal Weight previously, with a target price of $15, compared with $17, and a little below the stock’s Monday closing level of $15.81.

For F5 (FFIV) and NetApp (NTAP), her ratings dropped to Equal Weight from Overweight. Her target price for F5 is now $250, down from $280 but still well above its Monday closing level of $207.49. Marshall no longer designates the company a “top pick.”

For NetApp, her new target is $91, down from $102, while the stock ended Monday at $77.12. She also reiterated her Underweight rating on Juniper Networks (JNPR).

HP Enterprise declined to comment. F5 and NetApp didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Marshall says that supply-chain problems—and the higher prices that come as a result—could buoy earnings for the IT hardware companies in the short run. But she sees softening orders in the 2022 second half as a result of inflation, Covid-19, and geopolitical uncertainty. The analyst said she is starting to see “signs of weakness accumulate,” citing cautious results from a new survey of chief information officers about their hardware spending plans. She adds that in recent channel checks, resellers cited multiple reasons for caution about spending, including the Russian war on Ukraine, inflation and strong IT spending over the past year.

It may prove difficult for some vendors to have their customers fully absorb higher costs for components and logistics, she said. On HP Enterprise in particular, she noted that while the stock’s valuation isn’t demanding—it trades for less than 8 times forward earnings—she is wary about the company’s high exposure to storage and servers in a tightening environment for IT spending. Together, they account for 60% of revenue. She said she also sees risks in the company’s 37% revenue exposure to Europe given the situation in Ukraine.

Background: 

* Tesla reported strong vehicle deliveries for 1Q22. The company delivered 310,048 EVs for the quarter which was up 68% yoy, supportive of our thesis that EV demand globally could surprise to the upside vs. market expectation for **\~35%** global growth in 2022. Upside surprise in EV production could push the lithium market into larger deficit
* Elon Musk tweeted last Friday that the company is exploring investing in domestic lithium production as a result of elevated lithium prices
* Interesting timing, as on March 28th, Lithium Americas (LAC), a lithium mine developer, announced that the company is exploring potential separation of its US assets after receiving a permit for its Thacker Pass (Nevada) project.

2194,Paypal Founder calling out Buffett and the Gerontocracy,Discussion,"Lest anyone dares to call the finance section boring, billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel (of PayPal, Palantir and Facebook fame) took shots at fellow billionaires at a bitcoin conference in Miami yesterday.

**Them's Fighting Words**

Throwing hundred dollar bills at the crowd, Thiel hailed bitcoin as a youthful “movement, and it’s a political question whether this movement is going to succeed, or whether the enemies of the movement will succeed in stopping us.” Then he proceeded to call Warren Buffett the “sociopathic grandpa from Omaha” and ""enemy number one,"" along with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink the “gerontocracy” against the cryptocurrency revolution. According to Thiel, these large institutional investors ""need to be allocating some of their money to bitcoin,"" and they are holding it back.

**Pick a side**

Which side are you and your money on? On one side, Berkshire Hathaway did dismiss bitcoin as ""rat poison"" and may have missed out on incredible gains. On the other, are eternal cheerleaders like Block and Twitter founder, Jack Dorsey, who says crypto “changes everything” for him and “I don't think there's anything more important in my lifetime to work on, and I don't think there's anything more enabling for people around the world.”

For the rest of us plebs, most only recently considered investing in cryptocurrency and cannot afford to buy into bitcoin now.

**The conservative middle road?**

Berkshire ended up investing in NuBank, a popular online bank for crypto investors. If crypto feels too risky, but you also don't want to just wait and see, take a page from the Buffett playbook and look at services growing around cryptocurrency.

For example, Silvergate Bank is positioning itself to be the leading blockchain bank providing crucial behind-the-scenes services to cryptocurrency investors. It also has plans to be able to convert fiat into crypto in the future.

Are there any YouTube videos that explain it in a good, accurate and understandable way?  I'm horrible at math and numbers, so it's been kinda intimidating going into this topic.

I've tried looking at the resources link in the rules page, but a lot of it seems to assume that the viewer already knows a bit about stocks and investing.  I'm not trying to ""get rich quick"" or any of that, I'm just wanting to learn about the stuff overall

My entire experience has been this:

I downloaded Robinhood because a lot of friends have it, think of companies I think will get bigger or keep making money (idk stuff like Disney and Amazon, Bitcoin)  ""Funni number go brrr, sometimes it's up and sometimes it's down, that's about it.""

2198,4/5/22 SPY Daily TA,Technical Analysis,"  

4-5-22 Daily TA

Writing this from my new computer which I am very excited that it is finally fully setup and running like a champ! Cant wait to test it intraday tomorrow as my macbook air was struggling for sure with everything I had running at one time. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bnq3b0zn9tr81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b02799037a22e01e92ac6bc24b2e160c3a5e6b7f

Intraday today despite a morning start that looked initially to be bullish the bears were able to get control of the day. Of course, this was at the assistance of fed member Brainard who dropped the bomb about balance sheet reductions and the expedited timeline for the fed. This set the market in to quite the tizzy seeing a massive 0.5% sell off within 30 minutes of news dropping. Initially it looked like we may recover after a clear market over-reaction… thinking back to the Saudi oil field attack we had last week. However, after a small pop from the low of 453.8 to 455.5, the bears took back control and took SPY for an impressively bearish close below some key supports for a -1.25% close. 

The one thing I will be considering going into tomorrow if the markets took the opportunity to price in the FOMC minutes tomorrow and that the markets are assuming that JPOW had said and will be more hawkish than anticipated. However, it would not be surprising to see the markets react bullishly tomorrow morning before seeing a massive sell off once minutes drop. Historically thinking back that is how the last few FOMC meetings have gone. 

SPY today closed below a key “ level” of support of 452 today. The next support level is down near 448. It was quite the fight at 452.5 all day but I believe now that we broke below this support we may start seeing some more downside.

The daily chart for spy is quite bearish now. Looking back to March 29th we formed what I am calling the upper resistance at 462 and now we just may retest support down near 410 over the next month. Also today was the first candle closed BELOW the daily 8ema since March 15th. The bears tried very hard last week to close below but the bulls wouldn’t let it happen. In general a close below the daily 8ema is a bearish omen in the markets. We also broke the grey upward channel today officially.

The weekly chart is currently set up with another doji but any downward momentum from her will make it a true bear candle. The weekly 20ema and 8ema is still down near 445-446 which could be the target for the bears this week (that is also major supports on the daily chart).

Apple despite a bearish day tested the support of its channel and it is too close to tell yet on the daily chart if its broke it officially. It did manage to close above its daily 8ema at 174.83 which is a more bullish close for Apple after a -1.89% day. 

But as you can see on both SPY and Apples daily chart their daily MACDs are ready to curl to sell signal and the RSI is looking bearish both near 58 and trailing downward now.

The VIX had yet another wild day. Opening at 18.55 before climbing all the way to 21.57 before market close. That is another massive day, at 16% run up from low to high is wild for VIX! Again the VIX though was the guide of the market. Despite the expect over-reaction and mid day bullish reversal once the vix continued its slow climb up we knew that was not going to happen. 

Historically 16.5 to 21.5 over the last year or so has been the average VIX Range so we are not at the upper level of that. A VIX back over 22 would be quite bearish also and could allow for some increased volatility that we surely have been lacking. 

I will be gone in the morning with some personal stuff so I am going to include all premarket levels to watch here as I will not have time to post in the morning. I will be back on the server for live chat hopefully by 12 at the latest.

I would watch for a break of 450 cleanly followed by the break to 447.2. If we can break and hold there a close near the daily 20,50 and 100 ema all near 444-446 is 100% possible. 

Resistance- 

451.5 à 452.2 (break back above next “level” up) à 452.7(major support intraday today) à 453.4 à 454

0.5%= 453.3

1%= 455.5

1.5%= 457.8

2%= 460

Bulls will need a clean gap above 452 resistance that holds, good FOMC news and they could very well see 455 to 457 end of day with a run up near 460-465 to end the week.",txaisl,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/txaisl/4522_spy_daily_ta/

I agree with issue one and three, but personally I do not think that the EOs should receive a bonus compensation, considering they knew about the abuse at the company.

* less than 2% dividend
* buy with delta around .8+, depending on volume and spread
* 6-9 months left and reevaluate at \~2-3 months
* I will also likely do a covered call-like strategy, selling monthly calls at .1 delta

It feels like it may make sense to sell some of it, with the intention to buy back in when the price drops. But if you're sure the price is going to drop, does it make more sense to sell your entire position instead of just some?

Are there any tax concerns that need to be taken into account when selling some of a position whenever it moons and buying back in later?

Or is all of this a fools errand and I should just buy and hold?

An example of a stock that actually did this, would be EVGO last November, when it doubled in price over \`\`\`a week due the infrastructure bill passing and then immediately fell back to earth.",tw4w27,4,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tw4w27/should_you_sell_some_of_a_stock_if_its_price_has/

2208,How to create a Golf Portfolio,Industry Discussion,"TL;DR:
I believe golf related industries, ie. club manufactures, ball manufacturers, merchandising manufacturers and retailers, course maintenance equipment, etc. will grow at an increased rate over the next decade or more. How do I create a portfolio to capitalize on this? I’m curious to hear any suggested companies / allocations, or if any one knows of any funds/ETFs/etc. that focus on golf. 


Justification:
Partially anecdotal, I am seeing and hearing more and more people getting into golf. It seems like everyone and their mother is now all of a sudden interested in playing golf multiple times a month. Additionally, the largest generational bubble since the baby boomers are now reaching the age where they beginning to be interested in the game as a past time / business thing / whatever, and also have the disposable income to spend on this incredibly expensive game. 

As this population ages there will only be an increasing boom in the industry and its interest. We’re already seeing “younger” interest in the game in social spheres such as Barstool Sports, companies like Top Golf are expanding, in home tech like virtual ball tracking/hitting setups are getting more popular. 

I think the potential is there, open to anybody’s 2 cents on the matter.",ttw8ff,6,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ttw8ff/how_to_create_a_golf_portfolio/
2209,"Wondering if my buy instinct is good on Jazz Pharma. (Asking for any confirmation or second opinions, details below)",Advice,"The news situation as followed is Jazz Pharmaceuticals sold Sunosi, a drug, to Axsome Therapeutics for 53 million + royalties.  

Axsome has a little bump the last couple days, but I can’t see them making any short-term gains on their next few earning reports being they just spent 53 mil.  I sold my shares with them with a 2% gain and it went up even more, but I just can’t see it being profitable in the next 2-3 months. 

Jazz is really ramping up on increasing their production globally as well with factory construction.  Despite it dropping $5 since selling Sunosi, I’ve been buying stock with the understanding that maybe the next earnings report will be good with the 53 mil + a good long term hold since increasing production now = future profits.

I’m just looking to make sure my logic is somewhat right and reasonable with the given information.  Don’t be afraid to tell me I’m wrong.  I’m still learning, I’m aware anything can happen and some crazy disaster can happen with JAZZ.

2216,Potential ASPN contract with GM for EV's?,Company Discussion,"When you first look at ASPN (Aspen Aerogels), you'll probably notice the bad fundamentals right away. -25 PE ratio, YoY revenue growth is down over 30% (but this may be due to supply chain issues), and a price to book ratio over 12. So why am I talking about this?

I was looking for major insider buys, and I stumbled across something very interesting. After two years of constant insider selling, the company director, Robert Gervis, made a $4.5M purchase of company stock last week.

So why would the company director buy stock in a company with shitty fundamentals?Aerogels are usually used in the oil industry and rocket ships, but when you go to Aspen's company website, they had a product that stuck out to me. They have a special aerogel made for insulating the batteries on EVs called Pyrothin. Accroding to the website its ""Starting at only 2mm thickness, our [**thermal runaway barriers**](https://www.aerogel.com/industries/battery-thermal-barriers/) can be tailored to perform in critical applications, including:

* Cell-to-cell thermal runaway propagation
* Battery pack and module barriers""

Now, if you live in the midwest, you probably know that EV's are bad here, the cold weather reduces battery life in the winter, and the hot summers damage the battery. Owning an EV here is an expensive money pit, and you'd save more time and money driving a BMW on our salt covered roads. Aerogels are great insulators, and if applied to a lithium battery, it would stop the batteries from A) starting fires, and B) make the battery life last longer and keep more consistent range.

On top of that, if you go to their investor page, the company CEO had some comments on their Pyrothin Aerogel:

Mr. Young commented, ""We are projecting solid revenue growth in each of our principal markets during 2022, including a tripling of our EV thermal barrier revenue to $20.0 million for the year. We are also increasing our investment levels during the year to keep pace with our rapidly growing e-mobility opportunities. This investment will be focused on establishing an automated fabrication operation in Mexico and enhancing the technical, commercial and operational teams and associated resources supporting our thermal barrier and carbon aerogel battery materials businesses.""

Mr. Young continued, ""While these planned investments will expand our Adjusted EBITDA loss and net loss in 2022 versus 2021, they position us for strong growth in revenue and profitability through the decade. Based on customer forecasts and our thermal barrier quoting activity, we are targeting to double our revenue to nearly $240 million by 2023 and to triple revenue from that level by 2025; and have the opportunity to deliver strong revenue growth thereafter through the decade with continued growth in demand for our PyroThin thermal barriers, the strong potential of our Aspen Battery Materials business and with other new business opportunities created by leveraging our Aerogel Technology PlatformTM.""

Now, I don't know for sure if GM will be that contractor, but it seems pretty likely. GM has said that it wants to produce 30 new EV cars by 2025, and wants to go all electric by 2035. On top of this, I think GM has already done some business with ASPN, and even named them one of their 2021 Overdrive award winners. GM is also planning to make fully electric Equinoxes, Silverados, and Blazers in 2023, and if you don't know, those are pretty much the only cars people buy from GM in the midwest, and if they can make these cars have a usable range and battery lilfe, people here are gonna buy these up.

The original plan was to use that money for a forever home as a fund for rehab or paying down the mortgage. Currently interest rates have pretty much priced us out of the local market. We are thinking that we could wait this out for up to two years. We are looking into short term investments for that money. Possibly something that could go liquid easily (bonds?) In case the housing market comes around in our area to something resembling sanity.
Our current situation:
Married with two young kids. The oldest is in kindergarten in Catholic school with a tuition of $4000/year. (Local school system is awful, which is why we are looking for a home).
We live in our second investment property. (Starting to outgrow it). With this house sale we paid off all debt except the mortgage. We make enough in rent to convert all expenses and same a little extra. We have an emergency fund for the house we live in, an extra from the house we just sold, and a third for the future house (we used a rough estimate and think it's pretty solid).
I have a job that will pay my a healthy pension in 15 years when I retire. We both contribute max to our 403b&457b. Cars are paid off. We live well within our means.
If anyone has suggestions, please send them my way. I'm also open to answering any questions presented to me.

* Raising interest rates will very likely suppress house prices due to mortgages becoming more expensive

So if 1)interest rates rise during inflation and 2)rising rates suppress house prices then how is real estate supposed to be an inflation hedge?

2239,Canadian Oil Sands: Buried Treasures,,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadian-oil-sands-buried-treasures-11647601381?mod=hp_minor_pos19

Dirty, expensive to extract and trapped by a lack of pipelines, Canadian oil sands can be a tough investment proposition. Yet a year of elevated oil prices has turned companies mining them into cash machines.

Soaring energy prices are set to reward almost everyone producing hydrocarbons: Major oil companies and U.S. shale producers reported record free cash flows in 2021 and should do even better this year. Analysts polled by FactSet predict that a subindex of U.S. oil and gas exploration companies in the S&P 500 will beat last year’s bounty by an impressive 35%. Impressive, that is, until compared with Canadian oil sands producers: Suncor Energy, SU -0.16% Canadian Natural Resources, CNQ -0.93% Imperial Oil and Cenovus are set to increase their free cash flow by 60.5% this year, on average.

Longer term, the bull case for carbon-heavy Canadian oil is shakier and will depend in part on a shift to a more nuanced view of environmental, social and governance concerns. Oil sands’ carbon footprint is high, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought social concerns to the forefront—Western oil majors almost immediately pulled out of Russia—as well as the perils of relying on autocratic regimes for vital commodities.

Energy investors today are laser-focused on two things these days: Immediate cash returns and ESG alignment. At the moment, Canadian oil companies are ticking the first box. A paradigm shift in ESG could really supercharge their shares.",tho8nf,5,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tho8nf/canadian_oil_sands_buried_treasures/

In terms of the current market, there are some potential opportunities with the current volatility to see some big swings up or down. What is your guys opinion on allocating Mabye 10% of a portfolio to play around with short term swing trading and (cash secured) leverage to take advantage of the volatility. 

For example many stocks have hit 52 week lows and seem to be finding support. If one was to look at fundamentally strong, arguably undervalued companies, they could be prime for an upswing. Now of course you can’t time the market but perhaps having this 10% of your portfolio to play with can take

&#x200B;

i'm pretty new to stocks and investing in general so please excuse my ignorance but i'm wondering why with seemingly healthy volume and the mentioned equity (ATRS) being featured in the news today that it's moving so ""robotically"" why it isn't a little bit more volatile? it literally shot up over 40% premarket and was one of the biggest movers today.

2254,Is this a good strategy for Index Fund Investments?,,"Hello,

I'm new to investing but have been doing tons of research and decided do my investing with Fidelity. I'm trying to come up with a strategy that would work best for me. I have a few in mind and I'd love to get your feedback.

Long Term Strategy:

I have a traditional IRA with Invesco. I was considering moving it over to Fidelity, then investing in the following indexes. Fidelity Extended Market Index Fund (FSMAX), Fidelity Large Cap Growth or normal Fund (FSPGX/FNILX), and Fidelity Zero Internation Index Fund (FZILX). From my understanding using Fidelity Zero would work best with tax benefit accounts such as an IRA account. My plan with these 3 is to basically cover all my bases. S&P 500, 2000 companies outside of S&P 500, and International companies for long-term reasons. (other options is to invest in dividen investments with auto reinvest, what do you think?)

Short Term Strategy:

I also then have roughly 5k I would like to invest in more of a short term. Basically use it to invest for the next few years (2-5 years) instead of having it sitting in a savings account. I was thinking of investing between Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund (FBGRX) and either Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index fund (FNCMX) or Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSLEX). My thought process behind this is because it's a shorter-term investment I'll push towards a more aggressive investment to obtain the most return possible in the shortest amount of time. (any other recommendations?)

Side Thoughts

Am I missing anything here? Does my thought process kind of make sense here or is there something else I would benefit from doing instead? (aka like a ""3 fund portfolio"" maybe like FSKAX, FXNAX, and U.S. Bond Index)???",u28wp1,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u28wp1/is_this_a_good_strategy_for_index_fund_investments/
2255,How is the NASDAQ going to react to today's CPI data?,Discussion,"Global equity markets are feeling the weight of soaring yields. Tech stocks in particular have come under pressure, and could be in for further downside as the US 10-year yield climbing to its highest level since 2018. 

The NASDAQ100’s rejection from its 200-day last week was the second time in approx. 2 months that the index failed to hold above this key technical level, potentially signalling a double top formation. Today’s inflation data is expected to come in above 8%, and if it can support yields to rise further in the build-up to the Fed’s next meeting, $NDX could be at risk of testing, and potentially breaking below, its previous lows around the key psychological level of 13,000.

However, despite the likelihood of prices remaining elevated in the foreseeable future, today’s CPI print might mark the peak of inflation. If the market decides to focus on this angle instead, it could help limit losses in the stock market, and potentially allow $NDX to form a higher low before attempting another break above its 200-day MA. 

All trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see how the market reacts to today’s data, and how the NASDAQ trades over the coming weeks.",u1vztl,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/u1vztl/how_is_the_nasdaq_going_to_react_to_todays_cpi/
2256,IRA Recharacterization Questions,,"I funded my Roth IRA for the 2021 tax year in 2021 up to the max. However, my MAGI is over the income limit, so now I'm overfunded and will be charged 6% a year that I'm over. My Roth IRA funds are all in equity and I would rather not sell any to get below the limit. I've already funded my Roth IRA for 2022 so I can't just move funds from 2021 to 2022.

My question is: if I do an IRA Recharacterization from Roth IRA to Traditional IRA selecting just those assets to get me below the income limit to avoid a penalty do I keep my stock holding/cost basis/acquisition date, etc in the new Traditional IRA account? Or are my stocks liquidated at whatever the market is at at the end of the day I make my IRA Recharacterization request and I now have to reinvest those back into the stocks I had previously in my Roth account?

2262,"Morning Update for Monday, 4/11/22",Recap/Watchlist,"Good morning everyone, hope you had a nice weekend. 

*These posts are for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.*

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* NTES: Potential support level at 100. Will look for upwards movement up towards 104 resistance if it can hold up over that support level. 
* SNY: Will look for continuation from the past few days of trading. Just be cautious, as this will likely get over-extended. Relevant support levels at 57, 55.50, and 54. 
* SST: Relevant resistance levels at 25, 26, 28, and 30. Relevant support levels at 24, 22, and 20. 
* UVXY: Will look to trade on SPY weakness. 

Gapping DOWN:

* TSLA: Daily chart looking bearish after gapping down below support level at 1,000. Also gapping down below relevant SMA's. Possible trade 960p expiring 4/22 (next week). Will wait for things to settle after open though, will want to see it reject the 990 and 1,000 resistance levels.  
* AMD: Gapping down below significant support level at 100. Will be watching for shorting opportunities if it is unable to to get back above that level. 
* XPEV: Potential support levels at 25 and 24. Resistance levels at 25.50 and 26. NIO and LI also worth following, all charts looking bearish. 
* COIN: Gapping down below 160 support. Potential support level in the 156-156.50 range, I'll be looking at shorting opportunities on a breakdown, then a retrace towards 150 support. 
* NET: Looking to open right around SMA(50) at \~107.26. Will look for retrace to 100 support level if it breaks down this morning. Possible trade 105p expiring 4/22 (next week). Sentiment changes if it gets back above the SMA.
* TWTR: Potential support levels at 44, 42, and 40. Resistance levels at 44.85, 45, and 46. 
* SNAP: Daily chart looking bearish after gapping down below relevant SMA's. Potential support levels at 34 and 32. 
* BCYC: Potential support level at 30. Potential resistance levels at 32 and 35. Will keep an eye on it, figures to stay volatile today. 

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* VERU
* AFMD
* ETON

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower to start the week. Inflation concerns and rising commodity prices because of the Russia-Ukraine war continue to be an important topic of discussion. We are set to receive the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month of March on Tuesday, and analysts are predicting a 8.4% YoY increase, the biggest leap since 1982. This comes just as Fed officials have been discussing more aggressive rate hikes. The Federal Reserve finds themselves in a very tricky situation, trying to push inflation down yet also not slow growth to the point of causing a recession.  It's likely the reason why an increasing amount of banks and firms are predicting recessions in the relatively near future. At the time of writing, S&P Futures are down \~75 basis points, Dow Futures are down \~45 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are down \~1.3%. SPY support levels at 443.50, 442, 440, and 435. Relevant resistance levels at 445, 447.50, 450, and 455. Gold continues to climb, and is trading just under the 1,970 level. I'm still bullish here and think we'll retest the 2,000 level in the not-so-distant future. I'll continue to say it: I think gold is the safest hedge at the moment. Crude oil continues its recent volatility, now trading right around $94 per barrel. Energy stocks are trading lower in premarket as a result.

I'm a buy and hold investor and most of my gains have come from long term positions in stocks such as NVDA, ADBE, AAPL, PYPL and GOOG, to name a few. Having said that, I did take profits when valuations got stretched, PYPL and ADBE are two cases where I've got rid of 80% of my holdings because future growth looked subdued compared to their earnings and sales multiples.   
In Nvidia's case this is an important indication that growth may decline some in the next few quarters, after torrid growth in the last two years.

However, I still think NVDA's long term growth story in datacenter, autos and metaverse is largely intact and **then some**, but in the current market environment where inflation and high interest rates are going to drive multiples down -  it would be more prudent to enter only after there is enough margin of safety. **At a price of $180, NVDA's 2025 fiscal year forward PE's and P/S ratios come down to  20 and 9, respectively. Those are attractive valuations and I'd add more than what I've sold. At $150 I would back up the truck.**",u0uymd,5,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u0uymd/nvda_take_profits_and_buy_back_at_180/

Shares
Australian vanadium:
On a weekly basis alone, the Australian Vanadium share (daily updated rating) was able to increase by more than 78%. This increases the company's market capitalization to $225.92 million.

Core business and future of the company:
The reasons for the price explosion may be varied, but there are two key drivers of the rally. On the one hand, the Australian government announced a few weeks ago that it would pay out 49 million dollars to Australian vanadium as part of the Modern Manufacturing Initiative (MMI). Given the current market cap of $225.92 million, this represents a significant cash injection. In addition to being used in the aerospace and chemical industries, vanadium is also used in energy storage applications. Vanadium is a key component of a new generation of batteries, the so-called redox flow batteries. Accordingly, a large number of future technologies could depend on the supply of raw materials from Australian Vanadium.“",u0dpdl,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/u0dpdl/australian_vanadium_stock_is_the_rally_is_going/

British American Tabacco

yup, smoking stocks. Not something I would want to own for over 5 years because health negative is not the future, they're somewhat inversely correlated with snp500 when it goes down. But for 2 years , great way to hold onto the value of you're money and even make some on it. British American Tabacco has a bunch of vaping stuff. They're with an 8% dividend and potential for growth. There's also IMBBY stock which is not as invested in it, but also has a high dividend if you're looking to diversfy",u02but,5,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/u02but/recession_proof_stocks_so_far_looking_at_unilever/

I have another $100k total in savings that I'm not even collecting interest in.

A ML person called me and is interested in getting me to invest with them in their managed accounts, which costs a .58-1% fee depending on a few things.

Is this a good idea?

I'm thinking I should save 6months of savings from the $100k and give the investor the rest?

2274,4-7-22 SPY/ Apple Daily TA,Technical Analysis,"Going into today we had a small gap of about 90 cents to fill left on the daily chart. While GAPs almost always fill an upside gap when we are in what appears to be a short term bear trend can be up for debate as there is no real timeframe for gaps to fill. It does appear SPY fills them two days later usually. 

With that being said we saw the bears take hold again today running the VIX back up to 23.82 intraday and a low of 443.53 before saw a massive (what used to be rare but is now common) mid day reversal of trend. While these trends are getting pretty darn old they are becoming fairly common. Again the hint was the back to back massive red candles at 1pm. From there she just kept falling. That 24 level seems to be key “resistance” right now.

As you can see we are within a clear downward what I call a double channel. We are currently trading within and bouncing upward resistance of the upper channel. 

Despite the big energy the bulls came with end of day we saw SPY stop dead in its tracks at 450.5 range and failed to break through that resistance for over an hour before it finally sold off right into candle with a nice fat red candle down to 448.77. 

With the gap being filled and the upper limit holding strong I will be watching for a sell off into after hours and for futures to take a small dip over night. I suspect we could trade around the 446.5 to 44 range after hours. 

Upper resistance for the channel (assuming we stay with in it overnight) puts resistance at 449.5 for open and support at 445.7 à 442 à 438.

While I am watching for a bearish formation (see the black channel down) I am monitoring for SPY to find support and continue on a bull run (red channel) of course while also monitoring for a bigger overall channel that I have not been able to establish yet. 

If the BEAR channel holds true tomorrows range is 442.3 to 455.5.  
 If the BULL channel holds true 445.5 to 460 is tomorrows range. 

The one thing while this chart is very busy I want to point out is the EMAs. Today we saw SPY dip below the 20, 50, and 100 daily EMAs for the 2nd time this week but failed to close below it again. On the upside we rejected quite firmly at the daily 8ema of 450.8. To me the breaking of the 20, 50 and 100 ema AGAIN along with the very firm rejection and red candle into close tonight is bearish for tomorrow and definitely for next week. We also finally have a true downward direction on the daily 8ema. 

Now of course if tomorrow bulls can get this up and over the daily 8ema and close above it I would think 460 comes before 440. However, I will be looking for bears to get back on track again tomorrow and close below the daily 50 ema at 445.3. However, a close below the 100ema at 446.75 or the daily 20 ema at 447.21 would also be a bearish indication for next week. 

We also have a confirmed daily MACD sell and RSI still a 53 trending sideways now.

Same thing with the weekly chart here the bears were able to get it down below the weekly 20 and 8ema which is very bearish and I will look for them to close this candle tomorrow below the 20 and 8ema at 445.38/ 446.64. A close there with a firmly red candle below the doji last week would solidify some red downside next week in my opinion.

The VIX has another MASSIVE day today with a total range from peaks to lows of 21.12 to 23.82 or a move of 12% again today. Some very big moves this week with the VIX that’s for sure.

Apple had a pretty unexciting day today finishing at a small 0.18% green. We saw it break its key support at the daily 20ema again of 171. However, it too saw an end of day bull run that hard rejected its daily 8ema at 173.72 to close at 172.14. With an already red after market i will look for that to continue over night. SPY bears will like to see Apple close its week out with a candle below the daily 20ema at 171 tomorrow with hopes of seeing 165-168 next week. However, the bulls need a close above the 8ema tomorrow. 

Range for tomorrow based off the current black bull channel puts us at 171.3 to 178 (unlimited upside tomorrow). The yellow bear channel (much like SPY) gives a range of 171.3 to 160 (unlimited downside tomorrow).

2275,4-7-22 SPY/ Apple Daily TA,ETFs,"Going into today we had a small gap of about 90 cents to fill left on the daily chart. While GAPs almost always fill an upside gap when we are in what appears to be a short term bear trend can be up for debate as there is no real timeframe for gaps to fill. It does appear SPY fills them two days later usually. 

With that being said we saw the bears take hold again today running the VIX back up to 23.82 intraday and a low of 443.53 before saw a massive (what used to be rare but is now common) mid day reversal of trend. While these trends are getting pretty darn old they are becoming fairly common. Again the hint was the back to back massive red candles at 1pm. From there she just kept falling. That 24 level seems to be key “resistance” right now.  

 

As you can see we are within a clear downward what I call a double channel. We are currently trading within and bouncing upward resistance of the upper channel. 

Despite the big energy the bulls came with end of day we saw SPY stop dead in its tracks at 450.5 range and failed to break through that resistance for over an hour before it finally sold off right into candle with a nice fat red candle down to 448.77. 

With the gap being filled and the upper limit holding strong I will be watching for a sell off into after hours and for futures to take a small dip over night. I suspect we could trade around the 446.5 to 44 range after hours. 

&#x200B;

Upper resistance for the channel (assuming we stay with in it overnight) puts resistance at 449.5 for open and support at 445.7  442  438.

 

While I am watching for a bearish formation (see the black channel down) I am monitoring for SPY to find support and continue on a bull run (red channel) of course while also monitoring for a bigger overall channel that I have not been able to establish yet. 

If the BEAR channel holds true tomorrows range is 442.3 to 455.5.

If the BULL channel holds true 445.5 to 460 is tomorrows range. 

The one thing while this chart is very busy I want to point out is the EMAs. Today we saw SPY dip below the 20, 50, and 100 daily EMAs for the 2nd time this week but failed to close below it again. On the upside we rejected quite firmly at the daily 8ema of 450.8. To me the breaking of the 20, 50 and 100 ema AGAIN along with the very firm rejection and red candle into close tonight is bearish for tomorrow and definitely for next week. We also finally have a true downward direction on the daily 8ema. 

Now of course if tomorrow bulls can get this up and over the daily 8ema and close above it I would think 460 comes before 440. However, I will be looking for bears to get back on track again tomorrow and close below the daily 50 ema at 445.3. However, a close below the 100ema at 446.75 or the daily 20 ema at 447.21 would also be a bearish indication for next week. 

We also have a confirmed daily MACD sell and RSI still a 53 trending sideways now. 

 

Same thing with the weekly chart here the bears were able to get it down below the weekly 20 and 8ema which is very bearish and I will look for them to close this candle tomorrow below the 20 and 8ema at 445.38/ 446.64. A close there with a firmly red candle below the doji last week would solidify some red downside next week in my opinion. 

 

The VIX has another MASSIVE day today with a total range from peaks to lows of 21.12 to 23.82 or a move of 12% again today. Some very big moves this week with the VIX that’s for sure.  

Before someone says “YoU cAnT tA tHe ViX” Yes I know this… duh… BUT you can watch key levels and right now this month the low has been 18.7 and the high 24.8. What the means to me is closing at 21.56 we are pretty much right in the middle of the current month range. Bulls and Bears both have a chance to capitalize tomorrow.

2279,4-6-22 SPY/ Apple Daily TA,Technical Analysis,"  

The coveted FOMC minutes release finally happened. What did we learn? Well not a whole lot new honestly. All we have learned is that clearly JPOW are hawkish and ready to do another 0.5bps hike in May at the next meeting. We also learned that the previously doveish members are now even hawkish. 

SPY had a massive gap down at open today from 451 close all the way to 447.3 at open, which of course left a big gap on the daily chart. We know how SPY does not like to leave gaps too… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qmol7nkx10s81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ed997097c5eed44c67a2a7a65e5a4f3fd8e8606

Intraday despite the massively red pre-market and first big red candle SPY traded within a pretty tight range hovering around 445.5 from 945am to 130pm. We saw some green start to take off right before the minutes dropped. They got a lot of people with the fake out (me included) with running it all the way to 448.5 before they dropped it like its hot to 444.2 immediately after. From there I saw some of the craziest intraday swings in such a short period of time that I have ever seen. 

Spy dropped from 448.5 to a low of 443.47 (-1.1%, $5) rose to a high of 448.93 (+1.23%, $5.5) and then dipped to 445.32 (-0.8%, $3.5) and rose to 448 (+0.6%, $2.7) all within two hours of trading. That kind of volatility has not been seen in quite a long time. And being end of the day those who were brave enough to play 0dte made some incredible gains. I was able to recoup my losses plus 2x daily profit on one 0dte put on the initial -1.1% drop along with a few call plays to hit 6x daily profit in one day.

It is not surprising that we traded so close to 445.5 all day as that level is a key support of the Daily 20ema. It looked like when the minutes released we may see an aggressively red day and close below those key supports near the 440 level, however, 445 proved to be too strong to break through today. We also found out that 448 to 449 was major resistance too, as anytime we touched it end of day we immediately rejected down.

With a clear MACD sell and RSI trending downward now, favor to bears short term.

On the daily chart you can see we technically still have about an 89 cent gap from 448.93 to 449.82. Some could argue a gap this small is not important and will not be filled yet. One also may argue since its to the upside the push to close it now is not there as much as a gap below would be. Todays close and post market still have some bearish flavor to it. However, being able to close about the EMAs is fairly bullish. 

Intraday tomorrow and overnight we need to see if 1. The gap will be filled up to 449.82 and 2. If the daily 20ema (447.05), daily 100ema (446.7) and daily 50ema (445.2) is going to hold as support intraday tomorrow with the daily 50ema being the key support. If we were to get a bullish push tomorrow the daily 8ema at 451.37 will now come in to play as possible resistance. Failure for bulls to break and close above that again would be bearish. 

If the bears were to get another true bear day I would suspect they will try to close near the 200ema at 439.82. That being the final support bulls have to hold before we would see 410-420 again.

The weekly candle is now coming in fairly bearish after a doji last week would hint to me that we very well could see some red next week also. Key support for bulls to hold would be the weekly 8ema at 444.88 and the weekly 20ema at 446.43. A close back below those would all be confirm a dip next week back near the weekly 50ema of 435.07.

The VIX had yet another massive day today from its low of 21.24 to its highest point of 24.78 ranging 16.6% of movement. This is three massive movement days for VIX in a row, yet we have not really seen a massive 2%+/- day for SPY yet. I believe tomorrow or Friday it is coming. 

The VIX key level to watch is 24.5 for the bears and 22 for the bulls. Now that the VIX is back ABOVE the average of 16.5 to 21.5 the bulls are in favor here as its is usually easier for VIX to unwind down with no new news than to go up.

Apple is looking similar to SPY on the daily chart with a clear MACD sell, and rsi at 53 trending down. Apple also has a pretty significant gap from 174.42 to 173.63 (0.45%, 0.79) on the daily chart. 

Apple found support today at its daily 20ema which has not ben touched in over two weeks. 

Apple bulls need a green day tomorrow to fill the gap up to a 174.42, however, they will need to break now resistance at the daily 8ema. 

Apple bears will look for a close below the daily 20ema at 170.96. Bears will not need a very red day to accomplish this and their ultimate goal will be to get Apple below the daily 50ema at 168.44(only -2% from todays close) by end of the week. If bears can accomplish this 157 to 165 will be back in play. A close below the daily 100ema of 165.31 (-3.8% from close) while a very tough chore to accomplish in two days, it is not out of possibility for Apple depending how markets react. 

The questions going into tomorrow is now that the markets have the full minutes from FOMC and nothing news wise until April 12th with the next CPI data…. Which I fully expect to be awful and another emergency/ surprise rate hike. With the markets now seeing the true hawkish fed and the new info about the balance sheets/ QT and rate hikes is the markets going to go back into full panic mode like January? Or will the markets too quickly price this in and return to full rally mode? 

I will be looking at tomorrows close and more importantly Fridays close for that clue. We have key supports and resistance that will give us a clue going into next week. 

I will be back on the sever all day tomorrow after taking the morning off for personal errands and I will also have a proper pre market post up around 9am tomorrow on the server for everyone.

Today was a pretty good day for me.

As I said I was gone all morning and ended up not trading till about 1230. I entered some Apple and Spy puts around that time that I held till the first big green candle at 2pm and sold both for -50%. I then was able to grab a nice 80% 0dte play on the way down to recoup those loses + x2 my daily gains goalI had another 2dte -20% put that I played on the first recovery bounce when it faked us out red before ripping green (which is when I entered calls). I then played two different 2dte calls one for 40% and one for 30%. Overall being able to hit 6x my daily profit goal is incredible. I look to go into Thursday and Friday with low risk and being very conservative as I do not want to risk losing all these gains on silly plays. Friday if I have a good day tomorrow will look for a slightly higher risk on than usual though.",ty0731,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ty0731/4622_spy_apple_daily_ta/

2281,Pitfalls of Chinese Equities,,"## The Big Picture

There are plenty of different countries and islands which Chinese firms use as a springboard to list on the NYSE or NASDAQ. The concept remains the same, and thus the most prominent and biggest company makes for an intriguing show-by-example: Alibaba. Without a question, Alibaba is huge, has plenty of customers, and offers a wide range of services. E-commerce, artificial intelligence, venture capitalism, Alibaba covers it all. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 and became the largest IPO in history (not just Chinese, but overall). The demand for stocks of the internet giant was huge and the underwriting oversubscribed. While insiders and sophisticated investors understood what the rights of owning BABA stocks entailed, most were blinded by the prospect to get in the action. Although it was an initial public offering, and the name of Alibaba was splashed across it, investors didn’t actually get a piece of the Chinese company but solely a promise to receive profits of the Alibaba Holding Group in the Cayman Islands.

I know. It’s complicated.

China doesn’t trust foreigners and consequently, Chinese law forbids them to hold strategic domestic assets. No surprise, the nation’s e- commerce flagship belongs to that untouchable group. Wall Street and stockbrokers are aware of that. “So why the fuck are Chinese equities even listed on the NYSE if we don’t get shit for it?”, you may ask. Good question and the answer is money. To solve the issue of foreign ownership prohibition and still offer a financial product to investors, there is a ""solution"" called variable-interest entity structure (VIE). Even though a VIE doesn’t give investors the right to receive a penny if Alibaba would default, it gives the holder of a VIE the right to receive profits from the emitting entity. In simple terms: Alibaba makes a profit and you as the owner of their “stock” are technically entitled to parts of that profit in the form of dividends. If you think this procedure is an isolated incident then let me reassure you: it’s not. Maybe the islands change to the British Virgin Islands or Bermuda but at the end of the day, Chinese equities in their traditional sense do not exist. To go around the domestic rules in China, companies set up an equity interest scheme (or profit scheme) through which investors can partake in the success of a publicly listed Chinese company.

Technically you can partake in the profits, but it's important to add that in the history of Chinese companies listed abroad, not a single firm has paid dividend interest to its shareholders. Moreover, the PRC could simply impose a rule that strategic assets are obliged to reinvest their profits instead of paying out profits, thus preventing a negative money outflow. Currently, there is no reason for the Chinese government to interfere in these practices as any IPO in the West just brings in billions of US Dollars for Chinese companies using shell setups in faraway islands. 

## Friendly Advice

I bought Alibaba shares because I believed in the business, the numbers, the growth rates. But I sold my shares because these companies were valued at similar rates to their Western counterparts, even though their share structure looked nothing alike. In my opinion, you carry all the risks whilst being subjected to three jurisdictions: the US, the Cayman Islands (or another island state), and China. The complicated setup of onshore and offshore companies also provides countless chances for accounting fraud, thus further reducing the reliability of Chinese corporations' balance sheets. It's virtually impossible to audit or verify their numbers. Alibaba is not worth its market cap. No Chinese company is. And not because their business is bad. It could even be excellent, but the issue lies in their structure, the accounting and the unknown political factor of the Chinese government. At any time the PRC can revoke the possibility that domestic corporations are allowed to engage in certain business practices such as using a variable interest structure. This would imply that, even if Alibaba is constantly growing, their numbers are valid, and investors are anxiously preparing to receive their first dividends, the PRC can just stop these payout, and no one could do anything about it.

I am not condemning the Chinese government to keep such options in place nor am I shocked: The PRC is one of the most consistent governments in terms of reaching its objectives and “Serve the People”. Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, and the likes are still able to raise foreign capital because foreign investors are willing to buy their so-called equities despite the rather shaky fundament they are built on. Stock markets, banks, and brokers are built to sell financial products and earn a commission, thus profiting from the practice. Still, if an investor believes that Chinese equities function the same way as American or European stocks, they are just wrong.

My advice to you is to sell your Chinese shares and move on. There are better alternatives.",txhoj6,3,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/txhoj6/pitfalls_of_chinese_equities/

2291,Generate Income Even In Flat Markets Using the Stock Market and Leverage,Resources,"# If You Had To Point Out The Flaws Of The Stock Market Relative To Other Asset Classes What Would They Be?

There’s a long list of them, high volatility, sequence of return risk, low cashflow, high efficiency and liquidity (this could be a pro or con depending on how you look at it), lack of significant leverage, etc.

Out of all those things however, we’re gonna focus on two of them. The lack of cashflow and the lack of leverage. Both of these things are abundant in real estate in particular. A good rental multifamily can be expected to have a cap rate of 7-12% with a cash on cash return ideally around 15% or higher. This is because 1: real estate does not rely upon appreciation solely, it relies upon the income it generates from the renters and 2: investment properties typically only need a 20% down payment in order to purchase.

That’s a 5:1 leverage ratio which would be impossible to achieve safely in the stock market.

Now it used to be that stocks had lower appreciation and higher dividend yields, however that has not been the case for 70 years at least.

[You can take a look at this dividend yield chart of the S&P 500 for reference.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b7b177-77f7-4479-a1bb-f3c197adc097_1266x594.png) Or you can look at [this Investopedia article.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/071616/history-sp-500-dividend-yield.asp)

# Luckily, We Can Turn The Stock Market Back Into An Income Machine Using Options

This is the whole premise of the theta-gang position. We replace our stock appreciation with premiums received from selling options as a sort of “dividend yield.”

So we turn to selling puts and calls on SPX or SPY or whatever index you prefer. That’s great, but if we compare it back to real estate, we’re still missing the essential component of leverage.

**That’s where leveraged ETFs come in.**

The pros and cons of LEFTs have been hotly debated, but what settled it for me personally was [this post by hedgefundie](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007) and [this article about volatility decay](https://www.afrugaldoctor.com/home/leveraged-etfs-and-volatility-decay-part-2). If you don't want to read through all of that I've condensed down [the important stuff regarding volatility decay and proper diversification in this post](https://premiumincomeinvestments.substack.com/p/using-debt-to-make-our-portfolio?r=1awcwu&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web). But basically, assuming it works perhaps we can change it from capital appreciation to income generation using options.

Surely that should work right?

Well it should… if we do it correctly to avoid assignment as much as possible.

Leveraged ETFs suffer from something called “volatility decay,” basically just describing the idea that a when a loss is incurred, a greater gain needs to be made to square ourselves back to zero. With leverage we magnify our risk to this factor.

So because we have more vulnerability to downside, let’s protect ourselves using a bit of probability.

# Using Standard Deviation To Calculate Probabilities

Let’s just assume for the moment that all market movements are as good as being random. Yes, they are based on data, but if we don’t have access to said data, the movements may as well be random.

Under this assumption we can then also assume that there are probabilities to which direction a stock is going to move. There should be roughly a 50% chance that the stock will go up or down at any given moment.

On top of that, we could also assume that larger movements are less likely than smaller movements, mainly due to the fact that it takes much larger sudden inflows and outflows of cash to make a stock behave that way. Now some stocks have a “relatively” higher ability to make a significant move in either direction, but even these stocks still have boundaries where they will be unlikely to move.

A good example of this how wild Tesla’s swings are relative to General Electric. Tesla has a higher relative swing compared to General Electric, but even Tesla is unlikely to swing to $30 or $5000 in the next year.

Now these observations we just made are the fundamental ideas behind the concept of “standard deviation.”

Standard deviation essentially says that within a given time frame (usually a year) a stock has a certain probability of being within certain price ranges based on its volatility (its ability to make wild swings like Tesla).

([Image I found that best illustrates the standard normal distribution I'm talking about](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a804d0a-1dd0-4ab0-ac16-994ad6ebfb38_1478x914.png))

As you can see at the bottom of the chart we see that at each increasing or decreasing standard deviation (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, etc) there is less of a probability that our data (or in this case the stock price) will fall into this range given a “normal distribution.”

If you add up all the percentages between -1 and 1 we get a 68.2% chance that our stock price will fall in this range. This is called the first standard deviation. If we expand out the -2 and 2 then we get a 95.4% chance that our stock price will fall within the range. That is called the second standard deviation. If we go out to the 3 on each side we get a 98.8% chance that the stock price will fall within the range. With each standard deviation the chance that a stock price will fall within the range gets higher, albeit at a much slower rate.

# So What Does This Have To Do With Selling Options?

Using these standard deviations we can get probabilities that a stock will fall within a certain range. If we use something called Implied Volatility we can figure out what the market thinks that one standard deviation is. Then using that, we can predict what probability our option has of expiring in the money (which is what we don’t want).

To find implied volatility we can go to a website like volafy.net and get the implied volatility percentage. In the case of TQQQ (QQQ leveraged 3x) the implied volatility is 65.40% at this time of writing.

Using this percentage we can plug it into a handy formula to calculate the standard deviation for any specific option.

The formula looks like this:

(sqrt(option days until expiration/365)) \* implied volatility \* current stock price

In written terms basically we divide the days until expiration by 365, then take the square root of that and multiply it by the implied volatility percentage and the current stock price.

That gives us the amount in dollars of the first standard deviation. If you take that amount and add it AND subtract it from the current price it will give you the range the stock will fall within 68% of the time.

Right now we are interested in selling puts on TQQQ without getting exercised, so we’ll sell at one standard deviation out of the money. At the current price of TQQQ ($61.55) the first standard deviation out of the money would be $51.23 (which is also 61.55 - 10.32).

If we go back up to our standard deviation chart we can see that on the left side of the chart (the side that represents our OTM options) we can add up all the percentages before the 1st standard deviation mark. This comes out to be a 15.9% that our OTM option will become ITM by expiration. If we are selling monthly options, this comes out to be getting assigned once out of every six months on average. To me, those seem like pretty good odds.

So let’s go down to the $51 strike put on TQQQ which is trading $116 per contract right now. That’s a 2.27% ROI in 24 days or 34.05% annually.

If we assume assignment three times a year that wipes out any premiums made for that given month we are still sitting on a 27.24% CAGR.

# But Wait, Isn’t This Riskier Than Selling Puts On Regular Old QQQ?

This is the beauty of it, you have the same risk of getting assigned on TQQQ as you do with QQQ if you stay at the same standard deviation, but still receive 3x the premium. This is because with TQQQ higher volatility we sell further OTM than we would with regular QQQ but still receive the high premiums due to it being a leveraged product.",twnf0j,4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/twnf0j/generate_income_even_in_flat_markets_using_the/

2293,"Thoughts On $RILY, $OPY, and $COWN?",Company Discussion,"I am currently looking at several financial conglomerates: B. Riley Financial (RILY), Oppenheimer Holdings. Cowen, and Jefferies Financial Group. These companies are all trading around the 3-5 P/E range, have gross margins over 80%, and strong growth in both sales and earnings.

Of these companies, I have been primarily looking at B. Riley Financial (RILY). Valuation wise, the company has 92% gross margins, 11% ROI, 25% profit margins. Riley is also growing its sales and profits extremely fast at annual growth rates of 67% and 56% in the past 5 years. At current prices, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 4.3% and a plan for $50 million in share buybacks was recently approved.

Insiders own a large portion of the company already at 27% and are still buying significant amounts of the stock. The management looks strong overall with the CEO being the founder and heavily invested in the company. It seems like he is aggressively pushing expansion through acquisitions.

One main downside to Riley is its debt which has grown quickly as the company has increased its acquisitions. Riley has $3.9 billion in cash with $4.2 billion in debt. The long-term debt/equity ratio is high at ~3. Additionally, a large portion of the company's sales and revenue growth is not organic and comes from acquisitions or from the shell company boom. Their revenues from some divisions are also very cyclical, such as underwriting and liquidations.

Oppenheimer Holdings (OPY) and Cowen (COWN) have better balance sheets but growth is slower and management is less invested. Cowen looks to be the more interesting of the two with 35% annual sales growth in the past 5 years and some recent insider buying. Both seem exposed to cyclic revenues with their involvement in IPOs and general market participation.

The Generation from 1980 to 2000 was born with internet in hand and it has accelerated from 2000 to 2010. Africans know more about American culture than you do thanks to Facebook, twitter, YouTube and now instagram in past few years.

The Arab spring was born in the internet. The new generation is heavily involved and they are molded by it. As these people enter the work life and getting settled with family life etc, they are not afraid or technology impaired like their parents to shop in internet. Latest bike, latest soccer shoes being pimped by Ronaldo in his his Instagram / Nike connection etc

Im approaching this from a general view. The previous generation transitioning into current adult life are more addicted to internet than Americans.

I have a few shares in Jumia and I think they are coming at perfect time. Its run by young techies and they have developed the logistics and have the data. Orders might be slow, problems adapting etc but I think the value of company is actually in the platform they have developed.

Holding long term is good idea as they sort out the culture shift, local problems etc

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* SPI

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open slightly higher to start the new week. Geopolitical concerns continue to be the main topic of discussion, as European countries consider further sanctions against Russia, in response to apparent war crimes in Ukraine. A global economic slowdown is looking more and more likely given the circumstances. Whether this translates into a recession remains to be seen. Jerome Powell has indicated that the Fed could raise rates by 50 basis points next, I'll be monitoring anything related to the Federal Reserve. In other news, TWTR is up in premarket trading after Elon Musk revealed a 9.2% stake in the company. S&P Futures are up \~20 basis points, Dow Futures are up \~5 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are up \~30 basis points. Crude oil is back over the $100 level. Potential resistance around \~104-105, but appears to have found support around 98 and looks to be setting up for more upwards movement. Gold is trading slightly higher this morning. Volume has been high the past month or so, with many investors turning to gold as a safe haven. I still believe gold is the safest hedge at the moment, and I've been saying it for some time now. Chinese stocks are seeing strength in premarket trading after seeing some volatility last week. Worth watching today and through the rest of the week, volatility should stay high.

*****
> The stock market is heading into what promises to be a volatile second quarter, but April is traditionally the best month of the year for stocks.
*****
> The major indices were higher in March, but they turned in a weak performance for the first quarter, the worst since the pandemic. Investors have been worried about rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and inflation, which was made even worse by disruptions in commodities exports from both Russia and Ukraine.
*****
> Stocks are typically higher in April, and it is historically the best month of the year for the S&P 500. The S&P has been higher 70% of the time and has gained an average 1.7% in all Aprils since World War II, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. For all months, the S&P averaged a gain of 0.7%.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 3.6% in March, and Stovall said the rally could continue. “I think we get back to breakeven, but then I wouldn’t be surprised if we go through another pullback or correction before we have an end of year rally,” he said.
*****
> Market focus in the week ahead will remain squarely on developments around the Ukraine war and on the Federal Reserve. The Fed on Wednesday is scheduled to release minutes from its March meeting, where it raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
*****
> There are also a handful of Fed speakers, including Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who speaks Tuesday.
*****
> Greg Faranello, AmeriVet Securities head of U.S. rates, said the Fed minutes could be the highlight of the week since the central bank is likely to provide more detail on its plans to shrink its balance sheet. The Fed has nearly $9 trillion in securities on its balance sheet, and a reduction of those holdings would be another step to tighten policy.
*****
> “The market is curious. They’re going to be looking for some clues in terms of how quickly, how big, what the caps look like,” said Faranello.
*****
> The economic data calendar is light, with factory orders Monday, international trade and ISM services Tuesday and wholesale trade Friday.
*****
> Traders will also be watching for any comments from companies ahead of the first-quarter earnings reporting season, which starts in mid-April.
*****
> “The first-quarter earnings have actually been improving in the last month, so that’s encouraging,” said Stovall.
*****
> # Farewell to first quarter
> The Dow was off 4.6% for the first quarter, while the S&P 500 was down 5%. The worst performer by far was the Nasdaq, down 9.1%. In the past week, stocks were barely changed. The Dow was down 0.1%, while the S&P was up 0.1%. The Nasdaq was up 0.7%.
*****
> Interest rates also moved dramatically during the quarter, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield temporarily touching a high of 2.55% in the past week, after starting the quarter at 1.51%.
*****
> On Friday, the 10-year was yielding 2.37%, while the two-year yield, which most reflects Fed policy, was at 2.45%. The two-year was yielding 0.73% at the beginning of the year.
*****
> Faranello said bond yields can keep going higher on inflation concerns, but they could consolidate before another big move.
*****
> “I think the market is looking for a new catalyst here,” he said. “I just think the first quarter has been about repricing the market, and we’ve done that...The Fed came out very hawkish. We made made a dramatic repricing. Now, we need to see more data to see how this is going to evolve in the second quarter.”
*****
> Stovall said the S&P 500′s first-quarter performance is one of the 15 worst first quarters, going back to 1945. After those weak quarters, down 3.8% or more, the second quarter was better on average. This year’s first-quarter decline was tied with 1994, which had the 12th worst first quarter.
*****
> After those 15 weak first quarters, “we actually climbed 4.8% in the second quarter and rose in price two out of every three times,” he said. But for the full year, the S&P 500 gained just 40% of the time, and was down an average 2% in those years.
*****
> But this year is a midterm election year, and in those years the second and third quarters are typically the weakest. “Of those 15 worst quarters, five of them were midterm election years, and of those five, the second quarter was up an average 1%, and it rose in price only 40% of the time,” Stovall said.
*****
> Stovall said the market could be higher in the second quarter, but it will face headwinds. “Oil prices are likely to remain up. Interest rates are certainly not coming down,” he said, adding geopolitical pressures are likely to remain. “I see the possibility of a 1% gain. We could probably eke out something good.”
*****
> Stocks were held hostage by rising and volatile oil prices in the first quarter, as the world scrambled to make up for Russia’s export barrels. Many customers refused to buy Russian oil for fear of running afoul of financial sanctions on Russia’s financial system.
*****
> After wild swings both higher and lower, West Texas Intermediate oil futures gained 39% in the first quarter, the eighth positive quarter in a row and its best first quarter since 1999. WTI was just under $100 per barrel Friday afternoon.
*****
> # Choppy, volatile market
> Joe Quinlan, head of CIO Market Strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, said he is constructive on the market heading into the second quarter, but he sees some rough spots ahead.
*****
> “We’ve got to work through the inflation problem, and the Fed catching up to the expectations of the market,” Quinlan said. “We’ve got to re-anchor inflation. It’s going to be a choppy, volatile year. We’re tilting more toward hard assets, whether it’s commodities, energy and natural gas.”
*****
> Quinlan said he leans towards equities over fixed income, which has also been unusually volatile. “We’re using equities as a hedge against inflation,” he said. “Within that framework is more hard assets, fuels, agriculture complex in general and metals and minerals.”
*****
> In the second quarter, the stock market will continue to adjust to an aggressive Federal Reserve against the backdrop of what should have been a solid economy. With 431,000 payrolls added in March, jobs data continues to be strong, but there is a fear the Fed will raise interest rates too quickly, derailing the economy and spinning it into recession.
*****
> Traders in the futures market expect the Fed will increase its fire power at its next meeting in early May, hiking interest rates by 50 basis points, or a half-percent. The Fed’s first rate increase was a quarter-point at its March meeting.
*****
> The market is pricing in the equivalent of eight quarter-point hikes, and Treasury yields have moved higher with stunning speed as market expectations for interest rates shifted. The two-year Treasury yield rose above the 10-year yield, or inverted this past week, for the first time since 2019. That is viewed by the market as a warning sign for a recession.
*****
> Fed officials have signaled they want to move to trim the balance sheet soon. Kansas City Fed President Esther George this past week said the Fed’s balance sheet will need to decline significantly. She said the Fed’s holdings of Treasurys may have depressed the 10-year yield, causing the yield curve to invert.
*****
> Faranello said interest rates could still head higher on inflation worries, but rates could consolidate after their recent run higher. The yield curve could also remain inverted.
*****
> “We can stay like this for a year-and-a-half. Everyone’s screaming a recession is coming...I don’t think the yield curve is telling us a recession is just about to happen,” Faranello said.

> # Here Comes the Best Month of the Year

> After one of the worst starts to a year ever for stocks, March has seen a huge bounce. Incredibly, the S&P 500 Index is only about 4% away from new all-time highs. The big question is can the near-term strength continue?

> “The good news is stocks really appear to love April. Not only is it the best month on average since 1950, but it has also been higher an incredible 15 of the past 16 years as well,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 has indeed closed green in April in 15 of the past 16 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blog-3.30.22.png))**

> Taking a deeper look at April reveals that it’s not just the best month for stocks since 1950—it’s also the best month in the past 20 years and the second best month in the past decade. If there is one flaw, it is that in a midterm year it ranks only seventh and is barely positive.

> # Asset Class Performance by Weekday

> As Vladimir Lenin once wrote ""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen."" For investors, each passing day of late has felt like a month, as Powell's Pivot, the Ukrainian conflict, rampant inflation, supply chain constraints, and COVID have caused rapid shifts in investor sentiment, leading to heightened volatility. With each day feeling like an eternity, we decided to look into the average performance by weekday to provide you with insights into trading patterns based on the day of the week.

> The last twelve months have seen a divergence in performance from the norms of the last 30 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, the S&P 500 has performed poorly on Mondays and Tuesdays before gaining steam from Wednesday through Friday. This diverges from the patterns seen over the last thirty years, in which Thursday and Friday struggled relative to the performance over the first three trading days of the week. This year, oil has averaged gains on every day of the week, but the strongest performance has occurred early in the week, which is interesting as Monday and Tuesday have tended to be the worst days of the week for oil over the last 30 years. Bonds have performed poorly in the beginning of the week over the last twelve months but have partially recovered in the last two trading days. Over the long run, the safe asset has traded narrowly with only Wednesdays averaging a loss. Tuesdays and Thursdays have been strong days for the US Dollar over the last twelve months, but these days tend to result in flat to negative performance when looked at over the last 30 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/SPX-daily-chg-by-WD-032822-2.png))**

> Below we summarize the cumulative performance by weekday for the S&P 500 over the last 30 years. As you can see, Tuesday has been the best performing day by far, booking performance gains of 160.5%. Wednesday has posted a cumulative gain of 83.6%, which lands the day in second place. Friday and Thursday have been the weakest days, booking a cumulative gain of just 27.4% and 28.2%, respectively. Monday lands in the middle, recording a cumulative gain of 41.3%. As outlined above, the recent shift in weekday performance deviates from the norms of the last 30 years as investors have come out of the weekend with fears but concluded the week with optimism.

> # Strong Performance at the Tail Ends of Breadth

> While the index turned lower today on weaker breadth, the recent rally for the S&P 500 has come on strong breadth resulting in the 10-day advance/decline line to surge to some of the highest readings on record. Monday and Tuesday saw 99th percentile readings in the 10-day A/D line and even after the decline today, the current reading remains in the 96th percentile. At Monday's high, the 10-day AD line reached the most elevated level since October 2020. On a sector level, in the past week Financials, Health Care, Materials, Real Estate, and Tech also all saw 99th percentile readings in their own 10-day advance-decline lines.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033022-SP-500-AD-Line.png))**

> In the matrix below, we show the average forward performance of the S&P 500 broken down by the percentile range that the index's 10-day AD line is in. Generally, lower readings in the 10-day AD line have been followed by stronger returns whereas higher readings have been followed by weaker returns. That is, except for the most elevated readings. Readings in the upper decile have actually been followed by more consistently positive and stronger than normal average returns for the S&P 500. In other words, strong breadth is typically a more negative signal for the S&P 500 going forward, but an extremely strong breadth reading has actually been positive.

> # Down Q1 Midterm Years & Bear Market Bottoms

> As we enter the last month of the Best Six Months, the market logged its first down quarter in two years since the beginning of the pandemic. Going back to 1930 when our S&P 500 data begins Q1 was positive 55 years and negative 37 times over the 92-year span. Overall, years that advanced in Q1 were up 46 of the 55 years or 83.6% of the time with an average gain of 13.2% for S&P 500. Years when Q1 was down, were positive only 16 of the 37 years or 43.2% of the time for an average loss of -0.1%.

> What jumped out at us were the midterm years that had losing first quarters. In the table we compiled here, the events during these years have an eerie resonance to what’s happening today in 2022. War, conflict, inflation, recession, and rate hikes were common themes in these midterm years. Only three of these 10 midterm years had sizable gains: 1938 (War in Europe), 1942 (WWII) and 1982 (Secular Bull). Losses carried over into Q2 in all but 3 years: 1938, 1942 and 2018. Third quarters rebounded in all but three years: 1966 (Vietnam), 1974 (Oil Embargo/Watergate) and 2002 (Iraq). The only real Q4 blemish was 2018 when the Fed hiked rates too briskly.

> In general, after a down midterm Q1, losses tended to carry over into Q2 and the market began to find its footing in Q3 and rally into Q4. Protracted crises in 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, and 2002 delivered the most negative results though all had significant bear market bottoms. At the Q1 crossroads in 2022 we are faced with similar conditions. Persistent hyperinflation (Jeff’s large iced black coffee is up 29% in the last month from $3.02 to $3.89), a rising rate environment that’s stoking inverted yield curve/recession fears, the brutal war in Ukraine and the new Cold War 2.0 with Russia are threatening a bear market on the backdrop of the heightened volatility we have been warning of since our Annual Forecast in December.

> # Bears Go Back Into Hibernation

> The last couple weeks of the first quarter have seen equities reverse a sizable portion of this year's losses and sentiment has rebounded in sync, though, bullish sentiment turned slightly lower this week in spite of the S&P 500's move higher. From the weekly AAII sentiment survey, bullish sentiment shed 0.9 percentage points coming in at 31.9%. Even after that decline, the current level of reported optimism remains above all others (outside of last week) since early January, but bullish sentiment still would need to rise another 6 percentage points to move back up to its historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While more investors are not reporting much optimism, fewer are outright bearish. Bearish sentiment fell for a second week in a row falling another 7.9 percentage points to 27.5%. With a little over a quarter of respondents reporting as bearish, this sentiment reading is at the lowest level since November. That is also now the biggest two-week decline in bearish sentiment (22.3 percentage points) since November 2009 when it had fallen 23.74 percentage points in a two-week span.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Finally, we would note that given bearish sentiment has plummeted at a historic rate without much of an increase in bullish sentiment, neutral sentiment has picked up the difference. That reading clipped above 40% this week for the highest level since January 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> Other sentiment surveys like the Investors Intelligence one and NAAIM's Exposure Index have also pivoted more bullish this week. As a result, our sentiment composite is close to zero meaning across these three indicators, sentiment is now only just slightly below the historical average.

2304,Where and How to check dividend history of a stock?,,"hello guys

was looking at a few dividend stocks om the NYSE and LSE.

Just wondering how i can check the dividend history of the stocks? 

do they always pay out the same ratio of earnings, like 50%?

or same quantity of money, like 1 dollar per share every year? 

or my big fear do they pay out as a percentage of their stock price, like 5%? as worried if that the case and stock price halves, means the dividends will half too. 

Where and how do you guys check something like this? 

Is there more i should look at when checking for a dividend stock? 

As goal is to buy enough to get $5000 a year in dividends stably.

2305,Eviscerate my Strategy,Advice Request,"Ok so using OCO, as a full time worker who cannot day trade, I came up with a strategy. I take a ticker that has a corresponding inverse or nearly so counterpart that are also all too obviously channeling and I set a stop loss and limit sell at the height of the channel and at a point lower in the channel. I collar the two tickers yet leaving enough room for the winner of the two to slightly run, and no matter if they hit their targets I'll scalp by the end of the week. I started practicing this casually, in my head ""paper trading"", and started recently with .001% of my strictly accumulating-and-investing, with reasonable hedges, portfolio. It's been fire. It seems by using common sense to pick out a sector or ETF and their inverse counter part of which those I feel will have some movement insures profit or the likelihood thereof.

This strategy has been fire. Before I start scaling up the strategy's profits, can anybody tell me how this strategy absolutely sucks balls?",tu3vkm,4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tu3vkm/eviscerate_my_strategy/

It is highly undervalued with a current price \~16 and intrinsic value somewhere between 41-100 depending on the metric used. It is currently trading at a nice 50-60% haircut. There are several uncertainties with it: semiconductor shortage, ever looming covid, gas prices, regulatory bodies, global tensions. However, it has a large moat and has survived several global catastrophes, depressions/recessions and will continue to thrive.",tto6j2,4,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tto6j2/stla_dd_deep_value_deep_dive/

2311,Swap & leverage taxes. help needed,Newbie,"Hello guys,

I   use eToro more than 6 months, all good so far. I'm trying to learn  more  things every day, so when possible I attend to online courses  about  investing. Some of them mentioned about diversification in  regards of  broker diversification - don't store all of your eggs in  same place ;-)

That's  why I  stared searching for a broker which offer the same services as  eToro.  Then I came to XTB - Polish broker, which operates in EU. I  played a  bit with their system, and it looks good to me.

Luckily   they seems to be very transparent, which is good, but I still cannot   understand few things in there. For instance, they have tax called:   adjustment fee and swap fee, but this doesn't make sense to me. Even I   went to their website I cannot understand why this is needed.  
Because I haven't seen this anywhere else, I'm wondering if this is acceptable/normal or not.

[swap](https://www.xtb.com/en/swaps-and-charges-kb)

A   yeah, forgot to mention - they do all of your positions with leverage,   which is also strange for me. In eToro I can choose to go with  leverage  or not.

Good / neutral - However, China is also a major producer of neon so we need not worry about the shortage of neon -> halt production in chips -> bringing modern world to a halt as there will be no production of any equipment that requires chips (TV, fans, phones, cars, computers, printers, medical equipments, etc). Politics may result in some bargaining and this may help resolve some of the shortage
3. Bad - TSMC only has 6 months of neon supply, thereafter we can expect the world to feel the impact of chip shortage due to lack of material (this is different from the ongoing shortage due to production capability, which can be addressed with time and building more plants. This shortage will cause more severe impact.)
4. Bad - AMD is a major client so it will be affected too since it cannot produce irs own chips. 
5. Overall - China will be a crucial factor in determining how bad the shortage of industrial-grade neon will be for the modern world",tr2864,4,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tr2864/can_anyone_eli5_on_how_impactful_the_neon/
2317,Expense ratios on inverse ETF’s,,"I’m having a hard time understanding how exactly the expense ratio is deducted when shorting with an inverse ETF. I’m using “SH” (Proshares Short S&P500) and I see the expense ratio is .88% which is relatively high imo. I’ve been searching relentlessly trying to get a straight answer on when and how the .88% expense ratio fee is deducted but it makes no sense to me. Normally I believe they are deducted from dividends but there are obviously no dividends on inverse ETF’s. Can someone please explain when and how this will be owed/paid? 

Is it .88% of what I’m holding at the end of the year? Is it .88% of every share I bought throughout the entire calendar year? 

I see it isn’t automatically deducted after I purchase it but I also read that holding it past 1 day eats into the profit from compounding expenses. I’ve held a small amount for a long period (3 weeks) just to test this out and no money has been deducted from my account or short position yet.

Does this mean that I would need to make at least a .88% return on each trade to outweigh the expense. That might be a stupid question but I’m completely lost on when this .88% is owed or how it will be deducted. Any info would be greatly appreciated!",tqgg2n,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tqgg2n/expense_ratios_on_inverse_etfs/
2318,Fiverr (FVRR) to post blowout earnings for Q1??,,"Hey everyone,

I work in the SaaS space - we use several devs/techs and half our team is in the Ukraine.  A ton of IT companies have dev/tech/UI/UX that work in the Ukraine.  


Our company is forced to go and find a backup team should we lose communication with our current IT team that are still located in the Ukraine.  As we've been looking, so many dev shops around the world are depleted and gouging prices on hourly rates.  The demand for systems like Fiverr or Upwork I believe are in high demand given the situation and losing lots of IT folks temporarily until the war ends.  


I was thinking that Fiverr and Upwork most likely are seeing a huge push over February and March and imagined there would be a dramatic uptick to their revenues.

2319,"Morning Update for Monday, 3/28/22",Recap/Watchlist,"Good morning everyone.

*These posts are for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.*

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* TSLA: Resistance level up by 1,100, with relevant support at 1,050. I'll look for movement up to the 1,100 level if it can hold over \~1,062 support after open. 
* BABA: Resistance levels at 115 and 116. Will look for retrace to 112 support if it rejects 115 resistance, room for upside if it can get back over resistance levels.
* MARA: Potential resistance level at 32. Will want to see it hold up over support at \~31-31.25 this morning. Will look to trade with crypto strength.
* XPEV: Premarket high of 29. Potential support level at 28, will want to see it find support above 28 when things settle after market open. 
* GME: Premarket resistance around \~156, with a significant resistance level at 160. Will be looking for more upside if it can get up and hold over 160. 
* STAA: Coming down off premarket highs. Resistance level at 85. Room for upside if it can hold over resistance, potential shorting opportunities on a breakdown.
* SI: Resistance level at 157.35, will look for more upside if it can get up over that level. Could provide shorting opportunities if it rejects resistance this morning. 

Gapping DOWN:

* AAPL: Premarket resistance at 173. Relevant support levels at 172, 170, and 168. 
* SE: Premarket resistance at \~111, with potential support levels at 109 and 107. Could retrace towards 100 support if it breaks down below support levels. 
* BYND: Support level at 45. 
* JD: Resistance levels at 58 and 60. Will look for retrace to 55 support if it rejects resistance levels. 
* OXY: Premarket support at \~57, will look for weakness on breakdown. Other relevant support levels at 56 and 53. 

**Momentum Watchlist:**

* DLNG
* BITF
* HUT

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open slightly higher to start the new week, albeit somewhat mixed. Fed Chair Powell recently indicated a 50 basis point hike was on the table. We should be getting the March jobs report this week, and if the numbers are favorable, it could give the Fed the green light to start hiking rates more aggressively. It's worth noting that the market has rallied considerably over the past couple weeks. S&P Futures are up \~20 basis points, Dow Futures are up \~10 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are up \~25 basis points. I'll be watching \~453.50 and 455 as relevant resistance levels for SPY, with relevant support levels at 452 and 450. Gold appears to have found support above the 1,900 level. I still believe gold is the safest hedge at the moment. TSLA is seeing strength in premarket after seeking investor approval for a stock split in the form of a dividend. Worth watching closely today and the rest of the week. Also worth keeping an eye on other EV stocks. AAPL is down in premarket trading after reports of the company cutting iPhone and AirPods production.

Other means on male contraceptives are currently studied, such as a male pill but this one is still a little bit far down the road it seems.

2322,Is Dividend Reinvestment a Good Idea in a Volatile Market?,Help Needed,"I posted this question in a community for new traders and did not get a response (because we are all newbies there?) - however, I really need to understand if automatic dividend reinvesting still holds in today's volatile market.

I am new to trading and I try to do DD as best as I can. I bought 1500 shares in GOGL, 1500 in SSSS, and1000 in OTRKP. These are all dividend-paying stocks that are trading below their fair value. (I leaned heavily on [www](http://www/).[simplywallstreet.st](https://simplywallstreet.st/) and other such sites to make my buying decisions).

My first dividend payment was from GOGL in the amount of $900 (YAY!). But I chose automatic dividend reinvestment and that got me 73.463 additional shares in the company. However, those were purchased at a slightly higher price than what I originally paid. That increased my average price per share. I am now wondering if automatic dividend reinvestment is a good idea in this volatile market. I deselected the automatic reinvestment for future payments, but now I am wondering if I made the right choice. I missed OTRKP ex-dividend date, but SSSS will be paying dividends soon.

2331,Will bond market selling leak into stocks?,Discussion,"Bonds could face even more downside after Fed Chair Powell’s hawkish speech on Monday. With yields still near ultra-low levels, and the war in Ukraine set add to the record-high inflation, demand for bonds is likely to remain suppressed as a more aggressive rate hike cycle is probably needed.

Equities, on the other hand have held up relatively well so far, but we only have to go back to 2018 to see the negative effect an overly hawkish Fed can have on the stock market. Given the current state of inflation and supply chains, this upcoming tightening cycle will likely be even more intense. 

Using the S&P500 as a broader market gauge, the inability to consolidate the close above the 200-day MA yesterday might be an indication of profit-taking following the recent rally, and if shorts also see this as a good re-entry point, it could potentially drag $SPX back below the key 4400 level.

However, stocks are also currently providing a decent inflation hedge, and the market could continue to trend higher if the Fed navigates this rate hike path correctly. The lack of volume on yesterday’s decline might be an important signal that larger investors aren’t selling, and if $SPX can form a higher low above 4400, it might allow the overall market to sustain an uptrend. 

All trading carries risk, but it should be interesting to see how inflation and monetary policy plays out across assets in the coming weeks.",tm29l2,5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tm29l2/will_bond_market_selling_leak_into_stocks/

2335,Is it wise to hold Sector ETF’s and also Regional ETF’s?,Advice Request,"I'm currently holding the following Vanguard ETF’s:

* Vanguard S&P 500 (**VUSA**) - 35%
* Vanguard Europe ex U.K. (**VERX**) - 13%
* Vanguard Emerging Markets (**VFEM**) - 13%
* Vanguard Asia ex Japan (**VAPX**) - 12%
* Vanguard FTSE 100 (**VUKE**) - 8%
* Vanguard Japan (**VJPN**) - 8%
* IShares Physical Gold (**SGLN**) - 3%
* Invesco Saudi Arabia (**MSAP**) - 8%

Based on my current understanding, knowledge and future predictions - I’m very confident on the following Sectors:

* Semiconductors > **SMGB**
* Cloud Computing > **KLWD**
* Cyber Security > **ISPY**

As such, I’m looking to add these sector related ETF’s into my portfolio but I also feel I might overlap slightly with the S&P 500 ETF?

Is this wise?

Can anyone pick out any flaws or improvements to make?",tkr9nn,5,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tkr9nn/is_it_wise_to_hold_sector_etfs_and_also_regional/
2336,any angel investors- what is the pros and cons?,,"I recently started considering multiple vehicles for investment. My buddy is a VC and said he's interested in getting started as an angel investor and told me to check out the book Angel by Jason Calacanis. The book is awesome and makes the risks and benefits clear, but the message is that the reward outweighs the risk in a good volume of deals. 

I would love to hear from any angel investors on here of your experience. I want good and bad stories alike. Pros and cons. Risks, warnings, anything you can tell me about angel investing is greatly appreciated. 

Another priority is any educational resources you'd recommend to learn more about the whole process. I have a biotech background and need much further understanding of the financial side of this game.",tketwg,4,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tketwg/any_angel_investors_what_is_the_pros_and_cons/

2345,"Insider buying and selling, stock repurchasing and shares dilution",,"Want clarification on some things, if anyone can answer:

1. When insider (CEO, Director, etc.) buys shares - is that considered official company repurchasing or personal investment? When insider buys (in non-corrupt company), it is that their personal money used and not company's money?  
*ex. $ASAN Asana CEO was buying A LOT of shares recently - is that official repurchasing or just personal investment (or hoping to prop up the stock price)?*
2. When insider exercises an option and then sells the stocks - is that share dilution or are those shares already factored into 'shares outstanding'? Or dilution happens as soon as option is exercised and no selling has to take place?  
*ex. Elon Musk exercising options and selling - he was basically creating shares out of thin air and diluting the pool? (in his case, he was exercising for $6 and selling for $1000)*
3. When shares are repurchased by the company, using company's FCF/debt - are they getting destroyed (taken out of 'float' forever) or are they **not** getting destroyed, instead being stored somewhere (turned into preferred shares?) to be given away as share options to insiders later on or sold on the market in the future when/if cash gets tight?",tjbxda,4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tjbxda/insider_buying_and_selling_stock_repurchasing_and/

2350,"Playing with BP, when will it pick a direction",Advice Request,"10 - 3/25 BP $28p

So BP is currently trading in an ~$3 channel and I've been steadily making money on it for the last couple weeks. I had expected it to go up with all the other oil stocks with the cost of oil, but it didn't. Instead it's been trading in a downward channel. So, I hold puts until it gets to the lower support, then buy calls until it passes the upper support. I've done 5 trades this way and made about $200-400 each trade. I could have made more on these, but I'm trying to be happy taking profits when they present themselves. 

I think there will be a breakout soon, but I'm not sure when. Any other TA I should be considering? Advice appreciated. Thanks.

What does this all mean in simple terms?,," If a stock stops trading the shares remain in the account until they either start trading again or until the shares are removed by the depository (DTC in the case of US securities). That could be a short time or a very long time. It is important to remember that as long as the halted shares are in the account they will have a current margin requirement. In addition, if you have a short stock position you may be charged short stock interest if applicable. Investor bulletins from the SEC and Finra are available at the following links:

* I plan to buy risky stocks and hold for a long time (I'm willing and able to lose 100% of the money I invest).
* I want to maximize flexibility when it comes to the type of stock I can buy (different countries, different exchanges, different regulatory situations, whatever).

* I don't care about trading on margin or trading in derivatives; I don't really even care that much about trading any assets other than stocks.
* I am fairly paranoid about the idea of my broker screwing me, or getting hacked, or facing some regulatory issues that mess me up, or something like that, so institutional reputation and stability are important to me.

2373,Is HP stock a worthwhile investment right now?,Industry Discussion,"""Stock God"" Buffett spent $4.2 billion to buy HP! Since the beginning of this year, $21.4 billion has bought stocks of 3 companies.

""Stock God"" Buffett's investment enthusiasm was ignited. After frantically buying oil stocks and buying insurance companies, Buffett made another move to increase his position in the technology company Hewlett-Packard. So far this year, he has bought $4.2 billion worth of Hewlett-Packard shares.

Buffett, who once said in a letter to shareholders that there are ""no votes to buy"", traded a total of $21.4 billion in three companies in four months.

Continuous addition of HP

On April 6, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showing that between April 4 and April 6, Buffett bought a total of $399 million. Hewlett-Packard Company 11.1336 million shares, the purchase price is 34.88 US dollars / share to 36.43 US dollars / share.

Berkshire Hathaway, which previously held 110 million shares of HP, bought nearly 121 million shares this week, or 11.4 percent of HP. The shares are worth about $4.2 billion at HP's closing price of $34.91 on April 6. Affected by this news, Hewlett-Packard's shares rose 9.94% to $38.38 per share in after-hours trading today.

According to Berkshire's 13F quarterly report data disclosed at the beginning of the year, as of December 31, 2021, Buffett did not hold shares in Hewlett-Packard. This means that this year, HP has gradually become attractive in the eyes of ""stock gods"".

After the sharp rise in HP's stock price in 2021, it has continued to fluctuate recently. Since the beginning of this year, it has fallen by 6.68%.

This week's increase in HP has become Berkshire's other major investment since February 26 this year, and it is also Buffett's latest ""bet"" on technology companies. Previously, Buffett had invested in Apple, IBM and other technology companies, and his investment in Apple brought him a return of more than 100 billion US dollars.

The $21.4 billion blockbuster deal

Previously, Buffett said in his 2022 letter to shareholders that he could not find exciting investment opportunities in the stock market. But since this year, Buffett has made frequent moves, and the transactions of the three companies total about 21.4 billion US dollars.

Since the end of February this year, Buffett has spent a total of US$5.6 billion to increase his stake in Occidental Petroleum for three consecutive weeks, holding a total of 136.4 million shares, accounting for 14.6% of Occidental's total shares.

On March 6, Buffett revealed in an interview that he decided to increase his stake in Occidental Petroleum after reading the full transcript of the company's fourth-quarter earnings meeting on February 25, saying the company was ""doing the right thing. "".

On March 20, Buffett announced the acquisition of insurance company Alleghany for $11.6 billion in cash, a move that expanded Berkshire's portfolio of insurance companies including Geico and General Re.

Before announcing the Alleghany acquisition, Buffett had not made a major acquisition for six years. In his 2022 letter to shareholders, Buffett said Berkshire has $144 billion in cash and cash equivalents and pledged to keep at least $30 billion in cash on hand.",tyoh3z,5,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tyoh3z/is_hp_stock_a_worthwhile_investment_right_now/

2375,Understanding brokered treasury bills,,"After much digging around I have decided to put a fair amount of cash into Treasury Bills, probably the 52-week variety.  At first I looked into using Treasury Direct, but to be honest it looks like a lot of work.  So I fell back to looking at buying through Vanguard, Schwab and/or Fidelity as I  have accts in all of them.

In looking at their offerings (and the listing for same  all look similar) I noticed something I don't understand.   And I am loathe to put $$$ where I don't feel I understand.

I will explain my concern with an example.  If I look at the 1yr offerings I expected to see 52-week freshly minted bills that yield about 1.68%, the present rate. 

But there are other items offered.  An example of this would be taking the last year of a 5-year bond with a 2.65 coupon.  This guy yields just over 2%.  I don't understand this. Why would this offering yield more?  To me, since there is no risk involved in these bills/bonds, The yield should be closely related to the remaining duration of the bond, i.e. it should be about 1.7%.

Seeing this makes me think I am missing something.  Can anyone explain?",tyjk4n,4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tyjk4n/understanding_brokered_treasury_bills/

I am already down a lot. And I am so worried that I might lose everything. Any insights on how and when Nasdaq or SEC ever allow to trade again?",txt0ps,3,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/txt0ps/will_nasdaq_or_nyse_ever_unhalt_the_trade_of/

**Latest Ratings and Commentary**

# Twilio (TWLO)

Parker Lane from Stifel Nicolaus issued a STRONG BUY rating on Mar-31-22, and has a price target of $ 300.

Following a dive into the firm's Applications Software portfolio, Lane reported that he and his firm's enterprise software team reduced top and bottom-line estimates for the ""vast majority"" of the almost 70 companies they follow.

The low single digits percentage reductions (on average) are the result, the analyst said, of ""increasingly likely headwinds to new business activity stemming from the ongoing fallout of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""

Additional challenges for Twilio and its peers include ""accelerating supply-chain disruptions and the expanding impact of meaningfully higher energy prices on consumer spending,"" Lane added.

# Salesforce (CRM)

Daniel Ives of Wedbush (Top 10% analyst), issued a BUY rating on Mar-02-22, and has a price target of $ 275.

Ives lowered his price target on Salesforce Inc. by 12.7% following the release of the company’s Q4 and FY 2022 earnings report on 2022/03/01.

The company delivered ""headline results that handily beat Street expectations across the board,"" the analyst told investors.

Salesforce continues to prove to a skeptical Street that the controversial Slack deal will pay dividends ""in the field,"" Ives said.

The risk/reward on Salesforce is very compelling at present, the analyst told investors, arguing that ""the stock is way oversold relative to its impressive growth profile, cloud stalwart status, and margin trajectory over the next few years.""

# Uber (UBER)

Brad Erickson of RBC Capital (Top 2% analyst), issued a BUY rating on Mar-31-22, and has a price target of $ 50.

Citing a dive into the rideshare segment of his firm's Digital Marketplace portfolio (referred to by the analyst as ""findings from RBC's proprietary driver supply analysis""), Erickson reported that, at present, ""Lyft enjoys a relative advantage"" over Uber.

The analyst also said that Uber's share gains predicted in RBC's 2021/10 study have ""likely abated.""

The supply of drivers has ""arguably worsened"" for both Lyft and Uber, the analyst went one, a scenario that could lead to rising expense pressure, which in turn could result in a reduced margin upside.

2384,Are U.S. Treasury Inversions a Sign of a Bear Market?,,"First, let's review our March monthly report expectations and the actual trend of U.S. stocks:

&#x200B;

March was overall bullish. At the beginning of the month, it first referred to the vicinity of 2850-2875 and then retreated to the vicinity of 2800-2820. The S&P index rose 1.79% in March, but it was not a one-sided rise in January-February, but an N-shaped rise, with the highest point at 2860 and the lowest point at 2722

&#x200B;

The decline in March was mainly due to concerns about the economic outlook, with German bunds trading at negative rates following a more dovish decision at the Fed's March meeting, and U.S. 10-year and 3-month interest rates inverting U.S. stocks in the middle of the month. A single-day drop of more than 2%. Many people think that interest rate inversion is a prelude to a recession. 10-year and 2-year interest rate inversions basically have long or short recessions 1-2 years after the inversion, and the same is true for the stock market. Such a situation naturally makes the market bear sound. State street's Investor Confidence Index plunges into a very extreme state",tx8hqh,5,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tx8hqh/are_us_treasury_inversions_a_sign_of_a_bear_market/

# [Stock futures slip in early morning trading after tech-led rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures slipped in early morning trading Tuesday as traders continue to assess the bond market’s warning signals and the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia war.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 60 points lower, or 0.18%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down more than 0.1% each.
*****
> Treasury yields rose broadly Tuesday, but rates on some shorter-term bonds continued to trade above their longer-dated counterparts. The 5-year yield climbed to 2.6%, while the 30-year rate traded around 2.525%. However, the key part of the yield curve briefly uninverted Tuesday, with the 2-year yield trading marginally below its 10-year counterpart.
*****
> These so-called yield curve inversions have historically preceded recessions, so they are closely watched by investors.
*****
> Investors also kept an eye on Europe, as the war between Ukraine and Russia dragged on. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pledged to pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces, noting that more than 300 people were killed and tortured in a suburb near the capital of Kyiv. (Click here for the latest.)
*****
> “Markets have been resilient given the war in Ukraine, continued price pressures, and uncertain global economic outlook, with investors’ ‘buy the dip’ mentality driving equity returns,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research.
*****
> Oil prices, which have shot up since the onset of the war amid concerns over supply disruptions, climbed Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 0.9% at $104.23 per barrel. Brent crude gained 0.7% to $108.30.
*****
> Those moves come after a tech-led rally that saw the Nasdaq Composite rise 1.9% on Monday. Shares of Twitter surged 27% for its best day ever after Elon Musk disclosed a 9.2% passive stake in the social media company. On Tuesday, the stock was up another 1.8%.
*****
> The blue-chip Dow rose about 100 points to begin the trading week, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.8%, both posting their second straight day of gains.
*****
> “In the near-term, we believe indiscriminate selling has created attractive entry points, particularly into some high-growth-potential stocks,” Tony DeSpirito, CIO of U.S. fundamental equities at BlackRock, said in a note.
*****
> The new quarter has kicked off after the major averages finished their worst quarter in two years. Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve meeting minutes Wednesday for further clues on the central bank’s rate-hike path. Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season is set to begin next week.

> Friday’s positive session came despite March’s employment report, which fell short of economists’ estimates. The U.S. economy added 431,000 jobs during the month, while estimates from Dow Jones called for 490,000.
*****
> “Strong gains on the employment front continue to signal a green light for investors despite multi-decade highs in inflation and concerns over higher rates and Fed tightening,” noted Peter Essele, head of portfolio management for Commonwealth Financial Network. “The economy appears to be in exit velocity mode, with the only concern being the amount of labor supply available to fuel the robust recovery,” he added.

> On Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee will publish the minutes from the central bank’s March meeting, giving investors a deeper understanding into how the Fed views market conditions.

2405,Can the Australian market continue to outperform this quarter?,Discussion,"Apart from the FTSE, the ASX200 is the only major stock index that is higher YTD, as it managed to outperform during the opening quarter this year. 

Although this month’s rally, which saw the ASX break the key support-turned-resistance 200-day MA, was led by tech and consumer discretionary stocks as risk sentiment rebounded, it’s arguably the index’s composition that have helped it outperform, helping limit the decline in first two months of 2022.

While global markets where hit heavily by the prospect of higher interest rates and soaring commodity prices, the ASX200 was cushioned by its majority weighting in financial and commodity stocks. It won’t be surprising to see some profit-taking after such an aggressive move higher, but if the Aussie index can hold above its 200-day, it should help cement a new uptrend and put the record highs back in sight. 

However, this will likely depend on global risk sentiment, which still hangs in the balance as geopolitical tensions and concerns on overly aggressive central banks persist. Not to mention, the local market may also see larger-scale profit taking and rebalancing as the end of this quarter coincides with the end of the Australian financial year, and a close back below the 200-day MA could put the ASX200 at risk of a deeper pullback in the near-term. 

All trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see whether the Aussie market can continue to outperform this quarter as well.",ttmqb9,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ttmqb9/can_the_australian_market_continue_to_outperform/

2407,Good ETFs to hedge this inflation or potential recession?,Advice Request,"Hey all, hope everyone is well. I’ve been an inactive investor for about 2 years now. By which I mean I just basically set it and forget after I buy. I’ve never done any trading as I am only 20 and I am looking for long term returns. My portfolio is majority VTI as well as 2 other ETFs. Lately though will all the noise in the market around inflation and potential “mini-recession”, I have been researching and looking at some good ETFs to pick up to hedge some of the inflation/poor economy over the next 5 to 8+ years. Today I picked up XLE (Energy sector fund), VNQ (real estate fund) and XLF (financials sector fund). I know Reddit is not going to be my main source of advice but I did want to hear any advice anyone has on here? What do you think some good ETFs would be for the next 3 years? Any thoughts on the ETFs I picked up today. I’ve been researching for the past few weeks and have made a list but any new picks or ideas I would greatly appreciate. Also I should mention that I only buy ETFs, I plan on eventually buying individual stocks once I accumulate more capital and am able to focus a bit more time into the market. And lastly, I know the economy could easily recover and inflation may be slowed down significantly, as nobody can predict the market but I am just looking to trade right now based off what I have noticed may happen in the coming 3 years. 

*Note: I know I said good ETFs for the next 3 years, I know that’s a really short time frame. I’m not looking to cash out or make huge gains, I mainly just want a fund that hopefully won’t decrease too much in value.

2416,RKT - Bull thesis,Company Discussion,"We’re nearing the end of a pretty nasty downtrend trend for Rocket Companies (RKT), but it may be time to consider buying in at these levels for a long position. I’d love feedback on my thesis below.

It’s no secret that the stock has struggled in the face of raising interest rates to combat inflation. It’s been looming over the stock since early 2021 (aside from when it meme’d). Now that we have a little more clarity from the FED on what we’re dealing with and how we’re gonna handle it, the next few years may actually be favorable for Rocket even if on the surface, they’ll be making less money than they did during the pandemic. 

I believe the competition will be way more affected by higher interest rates than RKT. This is a reality that all mortgage companies have to deal with. But RKT has deep pockets along with more diversification into other revenue streams to wait out slower periods. I believe there will be more consolidation in the mortgage industry in the next few years (we’re already seeking it with moves like Better.com, look that up if you haven’t seen that mess) and it’ll only help RKT obtain more market share. 

The execs at RKT have also been very savvy with acquisitions to grow their platform outside the traditional mortgage route. I predicted that they’d start acquiring companies about 3 months ago (see post history) and they bought Truebill (a 1.275 billion all cash deal) a few weeks after my post. They’re funneling tons of cash into advertising this app. I see adds EVERYWHERE for it (youtube ads, public transit, etc) and it’s a brilliant way to get users in the door/into the ecosystem for more service offerings. The user base growth is a story no one seems to be talking about. It will be key in the long run as they strive to obtain the most market share. I expect another major acquisition to be done by the end of 2022 at the latest. Jay Farner (CEO) stated that they’d be very aggressive this year to acquire companies as they become more appealing to buy with everything coming down from pandemic highs. 

And the cherry on top, Jay also stated that he plans to buy $36 million of his own stock throughout the year of 2022. The stock price of 10-11 seems to be an established floor with the worst news already known and behind us. The upside heavily outweighs any risks that I see but I’d love to hear any *constructive* negative theories that you may have (especially at these prices).

Position, 3600ish shares (dividend $ recently reinvested back into the stock, rounding) @ a 17 average. I’ll be buying calls soon as well. Preparing to buy call leaps by the end of the week. I expect this to be a 20 stock by 2023.",tsdmcw,4,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tsdmcw/rkt_bull_thesis/
2417,(3/30) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Hump Day! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, March the 30th, 2022-

# [Stock futures edge lower after Dow and S&P 500 notch a fourth straight day of gains](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. equities futures dipped slightly Wednesday after stocks extended their rally in the previous session, even as fears of an inverted yield curve sparked recession concerns and investors continued watching developments play out in Ukraine.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 95 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.4%.
*****
> Russia said late Tuesday it would reduce its military presence in some parts of Ukraine, but several countries — including the U.S. and U.K. — remain skeptical over Moscow’s pledge. Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued Wednesday.
*****
> Crude prices, which have soared since the war began, climbed more than 2% to $106.57 per barrel on Wednesday. Germany warned of potential rationing of natural gas due to disputes with Russia.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a strong session, with the Dow and S&P 500 positing their fourth straight day of gains on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.8% in the previous session and now sits less than 10% from its record.
*****
> “The market’s now up almost 10% in the last 10 days, so we’ve had a pretty incredible rally in a very short time with not a whole lot of news change except that we actually have more rate hikes priced into the market,” Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, told CNBC.
*****
> “This has been a nice ride,” she added. “But I wouldn’t get too comfortable for the rest of this year, because I think we’re going to continue to see a lot of volatility.”
*****
> Several retail stocks were under pressure in premarket trading after disappointing quarterly reports, including Five Below and Chewy.
*****
> On the positive side, shares of chipmaker Micron rose 4% after the company beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Apparel stock Lululemon jumped 7% after issuing upbeat guidance and announcing a share buyback program.
*****
> All eyes were on the bond market Tuesday as the U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasury yields inverted Monday for the first time since 2016. Historically, this inversion has been a sign of a coming recession, though it hasn’t been a good indicator of when the recession would come. Still, investors largely shrugged off the event.
*****
> On Tuesday, the main yield spread traders watch, that between the 2-year and the 10-year rate, came close to inverting but stayed positive. On Wednesday, the spread climbed back to about 7 basis points.
*****
> “The big talk right now is that at any given point in time, recession can be on the horizon,” Lang said. “Typically, you won’t see a recession for an average of 20 months once a yield curve inverts. Our antennas are up that recession risk is heightened; that doesn’t necessarily mean that there’ll be one this year, though next year is more of a concern for us.”
*****
> Investors will be watching economic data scheduled to be released Wednesday, including economic growth data, home sales data and ADP’s national employment report.
*****
> Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, will speak to the Economic Club of New York.

It’s P/E ratio is at a 15.37 which on the low end in comparison to today’s market 

It has a good div yield at 4.27%

SMA 50 is at 79.05

SMA 100 is at 64.15

Price target by year end is $91.12

EPS is fine too at 5.39

Exxon has maintained its margins. I believe with the current gas demand it’ll have an excellent year.

2422,How to think about Start-up Equity during negotiations?,,"I wonder if this is a good place for this topic...  
I'm in the final moments of negotiating with a start-up for a director position. Comes with options.

I am a little confused about the strike price. In conversation, they said a number, but even though I've asked they haven't put it in writing. The offer is to ""upon first day of employment, propose to the board to award X# of common stocks"". The folks that I'm talking to were there before last funding, so maybe their strike price is lower than what I would get. Doesn't that line up?

New to this, but my understanding is that strike prices are usually equal to the FMV of the company's stock on the day the option is granted. This is a pre-IPO company, so private for now. Headed into another funding session. 

How far off am I on being concerned? Would a company simply give you $k worth of stock with value above the gift value or is it always you get it at face value and you reap what you sow in the value improvements? I'm under the impression I'll have 300% of the strike cost kind of built-in (obviously with the risk that come with start-ups).

2424,Outlook for $BRK.B for the next 12 months?,,"Hello. I'm from Turkey and if you follow the news regarding our country lately we have a hyperinflation-ish situation (which is still going on) in our country and a FX crisis (peaked 3 months ago but the fundamental risk still exists). In addition we have a huge boom in housing prices especially in Istanbul, which is where I'd like to buy a house. Real estate prices increased %20 in USD terms, whereas my salary is down like  %5 in USD terms (and I'm actually very lucky compared to the most of the other employees who didn't get this much of a salary raise since I got a %85 raise in TRY terms). So, in short, things are not looking good both for the time being and for the future..


As I said above I have an intention to buy a house in Istanbul but for this to happen, first I need to sell another house in a minor city where the real estate prices didn't increase much compared to Istanbul. So I don't know when will this sale happen and thus I'd like to invest my current cash position in a valuable stock which will perform relatively well for at least upcoming 12 months. When I looked into it, $BRK.B looked like an obvious choice for that kind of investment but I'd like to get your opinion on this. Based on the fundamentals, the company seems quite a bit undervalued right now. However on the other hand, it is currently in it's (almost) ATH price and the last analyst expectation for its price was $364, so it seems there's not much room left for the potential growth from that perspective. I personally believe in Uncle Warren and I heard that he bought some oil companies a while ago so even if we have an inflationary period of time for the upcoming 12 month, BRK.B might perform relatively well compared to the rest of the market, but overall do you think is it (still) a good time to buy this share at  the moment?",tqtegt,3,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tqtegt/outlook_for_brkb_for_the_next_12_months/

After last week's earnings call with Nike, John Donahoe stated that Nike will continue to supply FL with product. ([https://www.complex.com/sneakers/nike-foot-locker-not-cutting-ties-wholesale-retailers](https://www.complex.com/sneakers/nike-foot-locker-not-cutting-ties-wholesale-retailers)). This means that FL is a great buying opportunity because 70% of FL revenue is Nike and by the next earnings report FL will provide earning that are not as bad as the street anticipates. Over the long run FL should be back up trading in the 40's.

What are your thoughts?

2426,FAANG VS INDEX,,"So I recently started investing, realizing how I have money just sitting in a bank and not working for me. I recently bought stocks while the market was low.

My plan is to allocate my portfolio like this

70% VTI

10% Tech(apple +microsoft +google+ amazon)

20% VXUS

My question on here is should i still invest in MAANG even though the ETF covers it? MY friends say that FAANG can be used similarly to an index because they are safe investments ie google +apple +microsoft. They have said that since these 3 stocks have outpreformed the index it is safe to invest and hold them long term. So currently I own google + apple + microsoft and VTI and vxus. Should I continue to buy MAANG or chill with VTI and vxus? The reason I want to own google +apple + microsoft is that these companie scontinue to grow and dominate like they have for the past 10+yrs and these companies don't look like their slowing down and have really expanded their reach as well as having a cult following(especially apple).

2427,What is point of maximum authorized capital if shares can exceed par value on IPO day?,Industry Question,"My question is, let's say a company has an Authorized Capital of $1000. Let's say they issue 50 shares with a par value of $10. So, they are raising $500 total. But let's say, on IPO day, the shares sell for $100. So, they raise $5000.  But, their paid up capital was only $500. But they raised $5000. So what happens to that extra $4500? Is that money that the current owners can just pocket instead of going to the companies equity in the balance sheet? And what is the point of having a maximum authorized capital and a par value in the first place if, on IPO day, the initial price of the stock can be so much higher than the par value?",tqankj,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tqankj/what_is_point_of_maximum_authorized_capital_if/
2428,Lower prices for NVDIA GPU,,"Hi guys, as most of you probably know, graphic cards by NVIDIA have been very expensive especially due to the mining of crypto.

However, in the past few years, it has been unprofitable to mine Bitcoin with graphic cards due to ASICs miner machines that are much more efficient. And now, Ethereum is moving to a ""**transition to a proof-of-stake protocol**"" very soon, so it will be impossible to mine with graphic cards. All in all, impossible to mine the 2 main crypto currencies with a graphic card.

The cost to acquire an NVDIA graphic card has already started to decline over this weekend. NVDA is trading at very high multiples right now with a lot of growth priced in. We can anticipate a decline in demand for GPU, but also will the crypto miners turn around and sell their GPU pushing the prices down even more?

I wonder if this is priced in. A lot of analysts like NVDIA a lot, but I am not sure if those analysts are aware of that inevitable possibility of a pull back of people mining with GPUs which will affect the demand.",tpwioo,1,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tpwioo/lower_prices_for_nvdia_gpu/
2429,$D - Complete Technical Analysis & Play Setup - Clean Weekly Chart Breakout,Technical Analysis,"A lot of people forget boomer stuff like utilities exists - and I'm here for it. Often times the most neglected stocks see the cleanest movement. Anyhow, $D (Dominion Energy) had a fantastic chart breakout two weeks ago and has been getting going.

[$D - 3Y Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/43l2ald7dup81.png?width=2241&format=png&auto=webp&s=94c74254dd1a9f3266d7db65af7845c304d5566f)

You can see here we broke a long-term trendline connecting the February 2020 highs to the November 2020 highs. We also broke out of a broadening descending wedge that formed during 2021. Normally I look for at least three reactions to any trendline I am playing, or setup - but in this case there were two setups, so I decided to take the play.

I also noticed $XLU - an ETF this stock belongs to that encompasses it's sector - was also breaking out. When analyzing or swing trading any stocks, I always make sure it's respective sector ETF agrees with the move. This adds some confluence.

[$XLU - 1Y Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/qli5me6wdup81.png?width=2241&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc1ebaef6b73faaea2d00cdf88736f76eec1eb2d)

As you can see - this too had a pretty clean breakout from multiple patterns. One was a descending channel, and another was a bullish pennant. The third one you see that is cut off is a longer-term ascending wedge we have been chopping around for some time.

[$XLU - 3Y Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ze1ma0u4eup81.png?width=2241&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5e394c7991efbecf71f9aae552eb73f690028b6)

It doesn't have a terribly large amount of confluence, but it agrees with everything else. These data points combined were enough for me to take a full size position in $D stock.

**Plan for the $D Setup -**

* I have a position in stock @ 80.91.
* I am planning on taking 1/2 off for +4.09 points at 85.00 - there aren't many levels to work with up in this range and this is likely psychological resistance. I am happy with my profits here.
* I would like to take the rest of the position off at 90.00.
* If we close back under 81.21 for a weekly candle, I will trail out of whatever I am in and consider the play dead.

Obviously I am posting this well into the play - but there is a chance this back tests at some point in the near future and grants another entry, utilities can be choppy. Also, I don't recommend blindly jumping into random internet stranger's stock plays.

2430,"What kind of personal information do companies get, when I buy their stock through a broker?",Advice Request,"Random question because I've just received a physical mail from ProShares for having bought SVXY (Short VIX Short-Term Futures) shares last year, through a broker. Held for couple of days, sold for like $1 gain.

It's some kind of a tax aid form for 2021 tax return. They have my SSN, address, and list something called a partner account number.

Do all companies get my personal info from my broker, and also do they register me as a owner/partner when I buy their stocks and keep all that as record?

My naive ass actually didn't think about this part of stock trading. I hope the Chinese companies I bought didn't get all my sensitive personal information. Also those crappy meme stock companies.

Also, how come I don't get these physical mails from every company I bought and held? Also ProShares only sent me a form for SVXY, not TQQQ or SQQQ which I also own or had owned.

2431,A way to invest in Europe's transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy: ITM Power,,"For years European governments have been making a push to decarbonize, and this transition has only become more urgent with the rift that is growing between Europe and Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine. I first heard of ITM Power (symbol ITMPF) in late 2020 in a [Scientific American article entitled ""Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2020"".](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/top-10-emerging-technologies-of-20201/)

From the article: ""These and the other emerging technologies have been singled out by an international steering group of experts. The group, convened by Scientific American and the World Economic Forum, sifted through more than 75 nominations. To win the nod, the technologies must have the potential to spur progress in societies and economies by outperforming established ways of doing things. They also need to be novel (that is, not currently in wide use) yet likely to have a major impact within the next three to five years.""

One of the biggest criticisms of renewable energy like wind and solar is ""What do you do when it isn't sunny or windy?"" One of the answers is energy storage. When you have excess sun or wind, you store that energy for later, when it isn't sunny or windy. One way of doing this is by using excess energy to electrolyze water, splitting the water molecules into separate hydrogen and oxygen. Then, the hydrogen gas is stored until later. It is then piped into power plants and burned to make electricity, or it is piped into existing gas lines to heat homes, or it is sent to hydrogen fuel stations where it can refill hydrogen fuel cell cars. [These things are already happening in Europe.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-and-wind-power-could-ignite-a-hydrogen-energy-comeback/)

So what does ITM Power do? They make and develop state of the art electrolyzers used to electrolyze water to make hydrogen gas. [They are already involved in several large hydrogen projects in Europe.](https://itm-power.com/projects) I expect that the demand for their products will only grow in coming years. For transparency's sake, know that I currently own 94 shares in ITMPF",torgms,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/torgms/a_way_to_invest_in_europes_transition_away_from/
2432,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 25, 2022",Recap/Watchlist,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 25, 2022**

Stocks closed mixed on Friday to close out the second straight week of gains as market participants continue digesting developments coming out of Russia’s war in Ukraine, new sanctions against Russia, and the path forward for interest rates after new, hawkish comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell

**Markets Today** 

* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.48%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.08%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.42%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.16%

* Southwestern Energy (SWN): +14.29%

In geopolitical news, the US and allies will expand sanctions against Russia in response to its unwarranted invasion of Ukraine. The new sanction target hundreds of members of the Russian parliament and the CEO of the largest bank in the country. Most significantly, the US Department of the Treasury warned that any gold-related transactions involving Russia may be sanctionable by US authorities. 

A senior administrator at the Treasury said, “Our purpose here is to methodically remove the benefits and privileges Russia once enjoyed as a participant in the international economic order.” As a reminder, Russia has already been expelled from the SWIFT international payment system, which essentially freezes banks from sending or receiving transactions. 

The initiatives come as President Joe Biden and NATO allies convene in Brussels for a series of summits to discuss the conflict.

Despite the ongoing geopolitical conflict and a chorus of Federal Reserve officials saying a $0.50 basis point hike may be necessary, stocks have remained relatively resilient.   Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said Thursday he was ""open"" to the notion of a 50 basis-point interest rate hike at a forthcoming Fed meeting if needed. This echoed remarks from other Fed policymakers including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said earlier this week that if the Fed needed to do 50 basis points, then ""50 is what we'll do."" Fed Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week also signaled a willingness to roll out a larger-than-typical 50-basis point rate hike to address inflation, if deemed necessary.

**Highlights** 

* The University of Michigan's final consumer sentiment index for March fell to 59.4 from a preliminary reading of 59.7 and 62.8 in the prior month.
* Pending home sales, which tracks the number of homes that are under contract to be sold, fell for the fourth straight month. The National Association of Realtors’ Pending Home Sales Index fell 5.4% year over year in February. Analysts had predicted a 1% increase
* Salesforce (CRM) said it will change its legal name to Salesforce, Inc. from Salesforce.com, inc., effective April 4.
* Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) is has reached a settlement with GameStop executive chairman Ryan Cohen. The deal will see three board members immediately added to Bed Bath & Beyond: Marjorie L. Bowen, Shelly C. Lombard, and Ben Rosenzweig. Cohen, founder of the online pet goods retailer Chewy, disclosed a 9.8% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond earlier in March.
* Apple has yet to fully comply with an order to open its App Store to rival forms of payment for dating apps in the Netherlands and faces another fine next week unless it tweaks its proposal, Dutch antitrust watchdog ACM said on Friday.
* Apple has suspended its Apple Pay service for Russia's Mir card payment system, Russia's largest lender and payments system said on Friday, closing a loophole that had allowed Russians to keep using the service.
* NIO stock fell roughly 10% after the company’s delivery guidance underperformed Wall Street expectations. 
* BoFA now expects two hikes of 50 basis points each at the Fed's June and July meetings with ""risks"" of those expectations being pulled forward into May and June respectively. ""Our economists also now expect the Fed to keep hiking each meeting until they reach a 3-3.25% range in May '23,"" economists at the bank said. ""This represents a 25 bps higher terminal rate achieved 7 months earlier vs previously forecast.""
* Tesla Inc is recalling 947 vehicles in the United States because the rearview image may not immediately display when they begin to reverse, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said.

My thoughts are that if the dollar is strong and rates go up (which tends to make the dollar stronger domestically speaking at least), then could we be heading towards deflation? 

With high inflation and high rates it could stall the velocity of cash a lot and help accelerate this deflationary process along with a strong dollar. 

Just think, we could have 4x the amount of cash in circulation but if nobody is spending it then the market will come down. Regardless of that, I hear American savings are low again so most consumers have spent their money already anyway.

2440,How will the current political situation affect the average households in the US?,,"&#x200B;

Hello everybody!

&#x200B;

I guess there is no need to mention what’s going on with the World at the moment. Import/export sanctions and embargo already hit each country’s economy. But it’s on a global scale. As an average US household, I’m writing to discuss how all these sanctions will affect us.

&#x200B;

That thing why this question bothers me a lot is that I’m 26 y.o. I’m not an expert in the macroeconomy and stuff like that. I just read news like anyone else and figure out what to do with it. I already notice how prices slowly but steadily go up. There is no need to be an economist to analyze it. It’s enough just to compare your previous recipes for gas and grocery stores. I already pay more than I can actually make.

&#x200B;

As a young adult, I also consider that sooner or later, I will move out from the rented apartment, which I share with two other people. Besides, I also plan to start a family and purchase a house. I wanna my kids to go to college as I did in my life. I suppose that everyone plans the same things for their life.

&#x200B;

Apart from that, I also plan my retirement. I know it might seem a bit too early for my age. But, it’s good that I’m planning my future ahead. At least I don’t find it bad.

&#x200B;

Another important moment that bothers me is that I want to reach financial independence. I know that it’s hard to achieve, but it’s possible. At the moment I live on my salary. I try to spend on things really necessary, such as food, rent, and some classes. I try to avoid unnecessary spending, but it’s not always possible. Well, I’m trying to save up money for a better future. But, again, with the current price level, it’s highly unlikely.

&#x200B;

I picked up most of the tips from websites, such as [https://www.moneyunder30.com/](https://www.moneyunder30.com/), where they share some valuable info for young adults like me, who are just starting their life. But, with the current situation, I dunno if those tips are helpful now.

2442,Sticking to the signals and getting ready to add,Advice,"One of the hardest lessons I've learned in the markets is to resist the temptation to make decisions based on what I want to happen, or what I think will happen, and instead follow what is actually happening. The easiest way to do that is to develop a strategy and stick to it when the signals pop up, regardless of what's in the headlines. Someone recently turned me on to the Heikin-Ashi weekly chart as a signal for going long, and it has a remarkable track record for identifying lows after pullbacks. Try it yourself - call up a chart of any major index and switch it to Heikin-Ashi candlesticks on a weekly time frame. The signal is amazingly simple: go long (or add to an existing position) whenever the chart displays a bullish weekly candle following a downtrend.

Unless something changes and we see a major end-of-week selloff, there is a buy signal setting up for the major indices this week.",tkwnko,3,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tkwnko/sticking_to_the_signals_and_getting_ready_to_add/

I’ve been looking into investing and I’ve read through the wiki on this sub, but still have some questions. 

I know that to start investing I need to set up a brokerage account and from what I’ve read Vanguard & Fidelity seem to be the most common. I’m trying to figure out which would be better for someone like me just getting started.

I’m not looking to be a day trader or buy/sell quickly. I’m more so of a “I just want to stick my money somewhere and leave it for awhile”. I know ETF’s would be better for me, and I’m also looking at REIT’s. 

I’ve also spoke with many people who have multiple brokerage accounts, whether it be with the same company or different ones. What is the benefit of having separate accounts? Would it be better to have ETF’s in one account & individual stocks in another?

I’d appreciate any advice on Vanguard vs Fidelity (or even another system) and any other tips on getting started!

2449,Covered call strategy Help needed!,,"Hi everyone, hopefully someone will be able to help me with this question. 

I have 100 shares of an index stock which I got assigned through a CSP. I've been selling covered calls while waiting for it to go up. However, it went up faster than I thought it would. To make my example simple. Say I was assigned at $60, it went all the way down to $35, so I was selling covered calls at $40, then $45 as it was going up. I recently sold a CC at $50 for $2.00 premium and it's currently almost at $55. 

So, if I were assigned today I would actually net a loss for selling my current shares at $50 (have collected around $600 worth of premium). Rolling is not really an option as the premium would be almost the same and I already rolled once so the additional premium is not worth it, plus I think the price will probably just trend upwards from here.

Scenario A) - Deal goes through. SP goes up close to $95 and you make a lot of profit, a lot more than the 20% you would have buying shares. 

Scenario B) - Deal falls through for some reason, maybe legislation stopped it. This will cause SP to tank but $ATVI is a great company with legendary titles (COD, WOW, etc) and should be able to rebuild their value by January 2024.

2455,Final Decision on my long term strategy,,"I decided to change up my Roth strategy a bit after taking all things into consideration from my last post. I decided I would add VOO to give a bit more balance so this now makes up a third of my Roth which initially was 0%. Even though I feel young enough to take big risks, I do acknowledge having some more balanced weightings in stable holdings is important even though I’m already contributing to a 401k and matching. Until I’m 30 now, I plan on putting half my Roth contributions into index funds, 25% in blue chip growth stocks, and 25% in more speculative high growth opportunities. All while matching my 401k at the same time. My final portfolio now is:

35% VOO
15% NVDA
10% AMD
10% SQ
7.5% COIN
7.5% SNOW
5% CRSP
5% AI
2.5% QS
2.5% FUBO

I have been really focusing on adding the higher growth stocks first. Since I’m up about 25% already, I plan to just DCA my index funds now and have 15% remaining cash to throw on spec when I sense good buying opportunities. I felt this worked out really nice since I bought heavy at the local bottom. I don’t feel FOMO on what could be a potential dead cat or not.. I primarily need to focus on buying indices to balance out my account now which makes me more comfortable to begin accumulating potentially on the local highs of that, compared to something that’s high growth related.",ti0rd8,3,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ti0rd8/final_decision_on_my_long_term_strategy/
2456,Anyone have connections with institutions? Did they buy this dip hand over fist?,,"Million dollar question.

Some talking heads believe the selling stopped, not that massive buying started. So, did retail prop up this week's rally? How would you interpret the charts?

If retail did this, you'd either have to wait for retail herd to sabotage one another and take profits, or for institutions to start shorting the shit out of everything again.

If institutions sat out during this rally, they will have to wait for the next big dip to buy in. Some were saying they won't be buying heavily until S&P drops to 4000.

On the other hand, some say institutions can't just sit on clients' cash forever. They have to deploy it, regardless of how overinflated stock valuations may be.

2463,Stock picks for Income Generation using CSPs,,"With everything going on in the world right now (Russian invasion, supply chain shortages, staggering inflation, interest rate hikes, etc) the markets can seem pretty uncertain. And you might be wondering *what am I gonna do? I'm down 15% YTD, that's basically half of last year's return figures.*

Well I have a solution, or more technically, something that I conceived while studying backtests and options data by people much smarter than me.

What's the solution? Selling puts.

I see you rolling your eyes, *this guy thinks he's a genius for discovering CSPs, what a moron.*

Something you might not have heard before is that CSPs outperform in both bear and stagnant markets. So while in the last couple years CSPs have underperformed relative to growth stocks, *when not if* the market reverses the pendulum will swing back towards CSPs outperforming.

[https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.4882&rep=rep1&type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.4882&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

If you read the article, you can also note another important thing on page 50. CSPs also realize a much lower standard deviation, in fact, it happens to be **50% lower** when compared to the S&P 500.

So what does it mean when you match the annualized returns (or sometimes slightly outperform) the overall index while also having a lower standard deviation? We lower the Sharpe ratio! Which makes our portfolio have better risk adjusted returns.

&#x200B;

So now we get to my twist. If you sell CSPs on the index you get better risk adjusted returns, but what if we now want to raise our returns to a point where we have the same risk exposure as the overall market?

We concentrate our holdings. Rather than holding the entire index we hold less stocks, which increases our standard deviation, but at the same time should also raise our returns. Now I may have lost some of you at this point saying to shy away from indexes, but bear with me a little longer.

*We don't need 500 stocks to be fully diversified.*

According to this article where they randomly picked stocks within certain indexes and then calculated the standard deviation based on the number of holdings, *the ideal number of holdings for large caps is between 15 and 26.*

[*https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2021/05/06/peak-diversification-how-many-stocks-best-diversify-an-equity-portfolio/*](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2021/05/06/peak-diversification-how-many-stocks-best-diversify-an-equity-portfolio/)

So that's the sweet spot, we find high yielding CSPs on blue chip stocks inside already built indexes like the S&P 500 and then pick between 15-26 of them to improve our returns.

&#x200B;

Conveniently, I've built a handy tool in Python that screens for these options within the indexes (which you can find in my post history [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/lzklj8/i_created_an_options_screener_for_csps_and_ccs/))  that uses Robinhood's unofficial API. I more recently rebuilt the whole project again using Python again, but this time with TDAmeritrade's API which is actually made for pulling options data.

So using that tool, I'm gonna lay out five CSP option plays that I would make for the next month.

**Sell CCL $15P 04/14/2022 for $29 to capture a 1.93% ROI**

This company has had some bad earnings since the pandemic started, but I think that it still is a good company with a low PB ratio at 1.65. As people return to their normal lives in the coming years they will want to go on cruises again.

**Sell GPS $13P 04/14/2022 for $22 to capture a 1.69% ROI**

This company also suffered from the pandemic, but is starting to make a recovery. Their PE ratio sits at 21.3 and PB ratio at 2.44.

**Sell FANG $105P 04/14/2022 for $177 to capture a 1.69% ROI**

Oil and gas company, pretty self explanatory. War makes oil prices go BRRR. PE ratio: 11.2 PB ratio: 1.58

**Sell KMX $80P 04/14/2022 for $120 to capture a 1.5% ROI**

Carmax is a retailer of used cars. With new cars suffering awful supply chain shortages, most people will be buying from sites like this for awhile. PE ratio: 14.2 PB ratio: 4.47

**Sell F $14P 04/14/2022 for $21 to capture a 1.5% ROI**

Ford is coming up with some great new vehicles. Their Mustang Mach-E gave Tesla a run for their money and they won't stop there. Their sales are also way up from where they were. PE ratio: 3.79 PB ratio: 1.76

&#x200B;

Another thing to note, the prices at which I say to sell this options are subject to fluctuation, if you try to sell them on market open tomorrow the prices most likely will have changed. If you want to know if the option still offers a good ROI just take the option contract price and divide it by the strike prices times 100. Then just convert that number to a percentage.

I'm 18 and about to graduate from HS to enter university. I've always had a desire for money and things as a kid and my parents told me I could buy whatever when I'm older and have my own job. They probably meant after college but I started to work and learn about investing in my sophomore year of high school. Once I had a consistent part-time job and began investing at 18 not too long ago, I've become much less materialistic.

I have a little less than 10k invested in stocks, but ofc am at a negative. I only have about $3k (though I used to have more) saved and nearly $10k in stocks, but am at a negative, of course. I keep a maximum of $1k in my primary checkings, and since I'm still a dependent, I use that excess money from my PT job to invest in stocks for my high-risk, volatile portfolio (all tech). Though I'm aware of them, I currently don't have any investment in bonds, mutual funds, index funds, or other ETFs.  I'll be paying attention if the market dips more to lower my DCAs.

I'll be in debt with at least $5500 in government loans for the 22-23 school year. How should I approach my finances moving forward as a dependent student?

My theory here is that someone in particular is trying to keep the price down (?). But I don’t entirely understand why. If you have any thoughts or an answer for this please comment below.",tzbfzd,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tzbfzd/hello_rstocks_i_have_a_question/

But I invested in a biotech company that started listing 3years ago. In their pipeline 2 potential drugs for a market that is estimated at 1% of global population. 

This week they got FDA approval to commercialise one of them. And now I try to understand market action.

They have 19M floating shares. At the day of approval 15M shares changed ownership, still end of dat the share did not rise. 

The next day it even dropped 10%.

6months prior to this approval day share value dropped 60-70%.

Q1, How do I cover myself with a deal if they company doesn’t achieve its goals so I don’t end up with nothing?

Q2, If I meet these targets how much should I be looking for?

2508,Is it time to look at nuclear energy - what are your best uranium ideas or supply chain plays?,Discussion,"The most overlooked advantage of uranium is that it provides a very low volatility (green) energy supply

\- Fuel represents only \~25% of energy generation costs (compared to >**75% for oil, gas & coal**)

\- Approximately half of that cost is related to enrichment, waste management, fabrication, etc., implying that uranium cost is <**15%** of the overall electricity generation cost

This implies very low demand elasticity to uranium prices, which means that the commodity price can increase significantly without impacting demand, which is very different than oil & gas, which are sensitive to changes in demand

It is incredible that with everything that is going on in Europe, Germany is scheduled to completely retire its nuclear plants by the end of this year.

Is it time for a nuclear renaissance ?

2509,I'm struggling to understand NAV and it's relationship to accumulating / distributing funds and share price,,"I'm planning on buying shares in a number of ETF's so I'm trying to get an understanding of their differences. Probably the most obvious difference is whether an ETF is accumulating or distributing.

I get the basic idea, a distributing fund will pay dividends to the share holders who can then optionally buy more shares or spend the money elsewhere. An accumulating fund will reinvest the money automatically which increases the NAV of the fund. 

I've probably read every page google has turned about this and I'm still confused. I understand the NAV is defined as the net asset value / outstanding shares but I'm not sure how this value changes and it's relationship to the current price of the fund stock. 

I think I've figured out accumulating funds: the dividend income is used to purchase more underlying shares but the number of fund shares stays the same so the overall NAV goes up.

I've [read](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/090415/how-do-dividends-affect-net-asset-value-nav-mutual-funds.asp) that the NAV of a distributing fund drops when they distribute, I'm not 100% sure I understand this. My best guess is that because the dividend payment is counted towards the asset value when that money is payed out the asset value drops so the NAV drops.

Now we come to share price: VUSA is currently trading at 65.77, VUAG at 63.91. The only material difference between these two ETF's (that I can see) is VUSA is distributing and VUAG is accumulating. Is it just coincidence they are nearly the same price? I, perhaps naively, would have expected the price of VUAG to be higher since reinvestment of the dividends causes the fund to own more underlying stock which surely would push up the price?

If anyone is wondering, I'm investing through a tax free savings scheme so VUAG makes more sense. I've previously invested a little in VUSA which I'll probably switch to VUAG once I understand this!

2516,My Case For Global Foundries ($GFS),Discussion,"I believe Global Foundries ($GFS) to be an underdiscussed and **undervalued** sleeping giant.

**Full disclosure, 10% of my portfolio is allocated to GFS**, and I will do my best to lay out my side of the argument and I am open to hearing others.

GFS is a major player is the ever growing semi-conductor market. I live locally and have personally witnessed the massive growth this company has seen. 

There is a growing demand for semi-conductors from not only the home and office computing aspect, but with national security/defense, electric vehicles, data centers, and more. Almost everything we use and will need to use in the future runs on these chips.

The U.S and Europe specifically have been put into this position where moving toward chip independence can no longer be placed on the back burner and must be prioritized. The U.S. Senate on 3/27 approved a bill to provide $52 billion in U.S. subsidies for semiconductor chips manufacturing

TSMC has been a large provider of chips for a variety of companies and countries however with the current geopolitical state with China and Russia it is becoming a less risk adverse play due to being located in Taiwan which leads me to Global Foundries.


Since we cant see the financials of the future lets see how they performed last year

**Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Highlights**

Record revenue of $1.85 billion, up 9% sequentially.
Record gross margin of 20.8% and adjusted gross margin of 21.5%.
Record operating margin of 5% and adjusted operating margin of 8%.
Net income margin of 2% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%.
Cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion.

**Full Year 2021 Highlights**
Revenue of $6.6 billion, up 36% year-over-year.
Record gross margin of 15% and adjusted gross margin of 16%.

GlobalFoundries chips are found inside smartphones, laptops, automobiles, VR systems, video game consoles, smart speakers, and are also used in artificial intelligence and 5G

Global Foundries has customers such as Ford, Qualcomm, MediaTek, NXP Semiconductors and Qorvo

and on March 7th GlobalFoundries announced it is delivering Next-Gen Silicon Photonics Solutions collaborating with industry leaders including Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc, Marvell and NVIDIA, along with breakthrough photonic leaders including Ayar Labs, Lightmatter, PsiQuantum, Ranovus and Xanadu, to deliver innovative, unique, feature-rich solutions to solve some of the biggest challenges facing data centers today.

As of today $GFS is trading at 62.18 and I believe in the next 6-12 months with the explosion of electric vehicles and sustained/increased demand with the expansion of fabs and projected revenue increases we will see a price estimate of $80 on average with a high of $100.

2522,Deferred Loss and Adjusted Cost Basis - an example. Can someone help me understand,,"from https://www.thebalance.com/wash-sale-rule-3192972

>The amount of an investor's loss is added to the cost basis of the replacement investment when the wash sale rule is triggered. This defers the loss until a later date when the replacement investment is eventually sold off.

>You sold 50 shares of XYZ stock for $5 per share for $250 total on July 31, incurring a $250 loss, then you purchased 50 shares of XYZ stock on August 15 for $6 per share, or $300 total. August 15 is within the 61-day wash sale period, so your $250 loss on July 31 was a wash sale, and your loss is added to the cost basis of your new investment.

Question 1: Why does it say 61-day wash sale period? I thought it was 31-day. 

>Your adjusted basis in the replacement shares is now $550—$300 from your August 15 purchase combined with your $250 loss from the July 31 sale. Your loss is a ""wash"" in this scenario, just as though you had held your original shares without selling.

Question 2: $550 is the new cost basis. Is this $550 figure derived by adding your wash disallow amount ($250 in losses) + $300 (purchase price) = $550 cost basis?

>The tax benefit of your capital loss isn't gone forever, but it's deferred. The loss on the original investment will be taken into account when you sell your replacement shares by applying the losses to your adjusted cost basis.

If you go to sell your 50 shares at $600 total, then you made a capital gain of $50, correct? ($600 - $550 (adjusted cost)) = $50. Seems fine so far.

After you sell the shares, suppose you buy it back within 31 days at $500 again, hoping to sell it at $600. This repurchase won't trigger a wash sale because there were no capital losses at the time of purchase at $500 again. Is this correct?",tvhjxf,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tvhjxf/deferred_loss_and_adjusted_cost_basis_an_example/
2523,2019-2022 Koch Bros ERA,Discussion,"Isn’t it odd that during the pandemic no one talked about Koch Brothers but yet they own the largest Paper and Pulp Manufacture: Pulp and Paper: Koch Cellulose, LLC, through its subsidiaries, produce fluff, market and filter pulps used in disposable diapers and sanitary products, fine papers, postage stamps, tissue products and coffee filters. WHO BASICALLY PROFITED… AKA CONSUMER PANICK BUYING?

Now we are in 2022 and who’s profiting again? Koch Brothers how….

2525,"Today, the three major stock indexes closed up and looked more green. What will happen next week?",Discussion,"Before Friday's close, the three major indexes ended a two-day losing streak on Wednesday and Thursday and rose slightly.

Among them, blue-chip stocks such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Tesla all rose, although not much, they were all green.

The red ones are mainly semiconductor technology stocks, banking and financial stocks, etc. In particular, Qualcomm, Micron, Intel and Nvidia all fell by more than 2%.

&#x200B;

Take a look at today's news:

U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by a seasonally adjusted 431,000 in March, below market expectations and the smallest increase since November last year.

The U.S. unemployment rate recorded 3.6% in March, which was lower than market expectations and continued to hit a new low since February 2020.

The fundamental situation of the economy has indeed improved compared to before.

RVLP was previously named OSMT and after divesting from its legacy business (generic prescriptions) it pivoted into the aesthetics/eye-care market.

&#x200B;

10-year trendlines:  SWK is currently 2 StDev below its linear and exponential 10-year growth trends, with 2 StDev at approximately 143.20 (my entry point).  Its current downward deviation from trend is its largest downward deviation in 10 years, other than the COVID crash.

&#x200B;

PE Ratio:  Current PE ratio of 14.89 is the lowest PE in 10 years, other than the COVID crash.  2 StDev from mean is 14.33, so it's basically within buying range.

&#x200B;

200-weekly MA deviation:  currently at -7% below the 200wMA, after the recent runup.  It was at -12%, which was the largest downward deviation from the 200wMA since the COVID crash.  The largest before was -9%, so this is still within buying range.

It’s a goal of mine to save up enough in about 10 years time, to make a down payment on a first home purchase (also enough time to polish the credit score). I thought it would be a good idea to invest my savings for this in securities. Here’s what I’ve come up with as a strategy, setting aside $250 (plus any dividends) a month for this portfolio (DGA!).

* VOO - 70%
* BRKB - 20%
* SCHO - 10% (always gotta be a little bit safe)

I would start by funding only VOO until I get past $1,000 and then bringing in the others. I work overtime and can increase hours easily, so investing more might be an option down the line. How does this strategy look in terms of investing to fully liquidate in 10 years time? Am I being too conservative? Also is there any better way than investing in a simple brokerage account?

PS: I’ve thought of QQQ, but I feel like it might be overvalued at this moment.

What are potential downfalls to this strategy? I understand that if the price sky rockets I could miss out on those profits which is why I only plan on selling 1 covered call for each.

2. stocks moved from Roth to normal (not that this happens a lot, but when you're over the limit you're over the limit) show up in the main account as 53,895,345,003% gains since the data of the bought stock that was transferred doesn't come along with it

Ideally, even more analytics as to what dividends are doing would be great.  I don't even know what's out there, but my current brokerage doesn't seem to be doing anything to improve the user interface.  

Like, for example, is there a favored brokerage interface for those who are into the FIRE movement?

2553,(3/28) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a frrrrrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, March 28th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures are flat as a big week of economic data kicks off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures were steady Monday morning as a week filled with key economic reports kicked off, and investors continue to keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve’s planned interest rate hikes.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 points, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.1%.
*****
> Shares of Tesla popped more than 5% in premarket trading on Monday on news it wants to split its stock so it can pay a stock dividend to shareholders.
*****
> The Securities and Exchange Commission filing said Tesla will ask at its annual shareholders meeting “for an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock ... in order to enable a stock split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend.”
*****
> Elsewhere on Monday, parts of The Treasury yield curve inverted on Monday, raising some recession concerns. Earlier on Monday, the yield on the 5-year Treasury note rose to 2.6361%, while the 30-year yield was down less than 1 basis point to 2.6004%.
*****
> However, the main yield spread that traders watch — the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year rate — remained positive for now.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 rose on Friday to close out their second consecutive winning week. The Dow gained 153 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5% and has more than erased its losses since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2% but still finished the week in the green.
*****
> The moves came as investors continue to monitor developments in Russia’s war on Ukraine and expectations about the Fed’s plans to hike interest rates.
*****
> “It seems the skyrocketing move higher with commodity prices has taken a break and that has allowed investors a chance to pile back into equities,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Geopolitical risks remain very elevated and the rally in equities over the past two weeks is impressive. The U.S. economy is still in good shape, but buying every stock market dip probably won’t be the attitude for most traders going forward given how hawkish the Fed has turned.”
*****
> Investors continue to keep a close eye on the Fed. Wall Street firms from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America penciled in half-point hikes in future Fed meetings this year after the central bank’s chair Jerome Powell vowed to be tough on inflation and said rate increases could become more aggressive if necessary.
*****
> On Friday, the benchmark 10-year yield touched a fresh multi-year high of 2.5% as investors priced in a more aggressive rate hike cycle, which helped lift financial stocks while tech stocks pulled back.
*****
> Investors are looking forward to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, this week. The JOLTS report is one set of employment data that the Federal Reserve is watching closely as it tightens monetary policy. ADP will also release its private payrolls data ahead of the main show, the closely watched monthly jobs report, on Friday.
*****
> Monday is a light day for earnings reports but several big companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results this week, including BioNTech, Micron and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

2554,Google/Amazon split question,Industry Question,"I'm sure a lot of people are thinking the same things, buy a few shares now, then you'll have 100 after the split and can sell CCs. While I was initially thinking of without a doubt doing this, as I'm sure there will be some juicy price action after the split I came upon a dilemma that I'm curious about. By multiplying the float by 20x, is that gonna just eradicate movement and end up hurting options pricing in the long run? Sure in the beginning I'm sure the volatility and open interest will pick up, but after that it kinda screams apple to me where premiums just won't be worth it.

2555,Capital gains and scalping stocks,Newbie,"Does capital gains tax apply to each individual profitable securities sale or is it applied to the total net profit after total losses are subtracted? 

I’m only now thinking about this because if the former is correct then scalping securities can result in taxes owed that in certain circumstances could throw you back in the red even if you came up ahead in your total profits.

As a hypothetical, (setting aside the 3k in losses we can write off) you buy and sell Stock A for a loss of $10 and you buy and sell Stock B for a profit of $10. If the latter taxing scheme is correct then the investor would have broke even. If the former, then the investor is ultimately in the red since he has to pay capital gains on Stock B.

So which one of these is the correct application of capital gains?",tq85t8,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tq85t8/capital_gains_and_scalping_stocks/

2557,selling ATM calls against dividend shares for half dividend yield,Advice Request,"Instead of buying shares and holding them for multiple years, I am thinking to buy the shares around 30 minutes before market close on the trading day before ex-dividend date. I will also sell ATM calls expiring soon (with expiration date this Friday or 3rd Friday of the month) against the shares before the market close.

The ATM calls sold will have time value around half of dividend yield. This will ensure there is a non-zero likelihood that the shares will be called away on the same day. For example, if a stock gives 4% annual dividend (1% dividend per quarter), we sell ATM calls with remaining time value equivalent to \~50% dividend received.

If everything goes well, we should net \~2% from the stock per year. It should not be too hard to repeat it 5 times to reach 10% annual return. Of course, we need to pick the stocks carefully (e.g., no stocks with 20%+ annual dividend that are about to bankrupt), and be ready to start selling more calls against the shares until break even if the shares are not called away.

This strategy may not be appealing in 2020 and 2021, but as the dividend stocks will be more favorable during high inflation period from 2022 to 2024, it looks like a very good risk-adjusted strategy.

2559,"ROTH IRA and YLDs, Long Term Idea",,"So this is my current ROTH IRA and im very proud of my current position, im 24 years old, make about 65k a year before taxes, i have maxed out my IRA since i was 18, i put in $125 a week automatically, currently have 65k assets, 32k debts, 780 credit score

so my Question here is im thinking about redoing my holdings in my roth ira, i wanna sell pretty much everything i own, liquidate 30k and move it into a more simplified strategy for long term investing and also long term cash flow, i understand i cant touch the cash flow until retirement age and all that

Also there is a very good chance that if the company i work for goes the way it should i can be well over the threshold of being able to contribute to my ROTH anymore, **Side Question, if in 3-5 years i make more then the threshold for contributing will it still be able to grow tax free with appreciation and dividends?**

so here are my thoughts, liquidate 30k and put into,

5k spy or spy alternative aka ITOT

5k XYLD

5k IJR or small cap fund

5k RYLD

5K QQQ or alternative, i dont currently have a fund

5k QYLD

my thinking is i can catch the upside appreciation with the underlying asset and DRIP with the YLDs so in 35 years i can be in a position of basically having all tax free income

This will only make sense for me based on the answers to my **side question,** because i plan to make more than 150k a year in the next 5 years and will not be able to contribute to a ROTH IRA anymore but wanna take full advantage of tax free income in the future

I know in a normal account it would make more sense to do all index funds and switch to YLDs once i actually need the income but my thinking is, this way i can snowball the YLDs and **grow the tax free income even after i can not contribute anymore** and also let the underlying assets appreciate for the next 35 years, leaving me in 35 years close to 100k or more of **TAX FREE** income every year plus the value of the index funds

I will continue to invest as much as i can split evenly between the holdings for as long as i can

**PLEASE leave any honest review and anything i missed that would make this thinking flawed would be much appreciated, can also tell me to just stick with what im doing**

I was going to keep my contracts to see if it shot up more at earnings, but looking at Intel historically, most of the time they drop pretty hard right after earnings.. And its not always because of bad earnings reports.  I have to go all the way back to jan of 2020 ( unless I missed one) to see where Intel actually went up after earnings.

I know we shoudl have our exit strategies, so mine is definitely going to be before earnings. I thought maybe they had a chance to shoot up some more after earnings because Nvidia and Intel doing a deal together.  Its been a nice ride so far, that is for sure, but I need to start thinking about my exit again. I had one set already, it surpassed it. I am not trying to be greedy, but I want to optimize the gain as much as I can before pulling the plug.

2565,Revenue growth for a sector or company does not necessarily imply market-beating returns.,Meta,"Some of the most common posts on this sub are those asking for recommendations of growing sectors/companies and those arguing for the over-performance of growing sectors/companies. Most of these posts make the assumption that revenue growth implies higher future returns. I think that is at best a major leap of faith and at worst a dangerous mistake.

From my vantage point, there are two ways to argue for the over-performance of a sector or an individual equity. Either it’s undervalued, in which case you’re arguing for higher risk-adjusted returns — alpha. Or it’s riskier than the broader market in a way that is correlated with other prevailing risk factors and thus robust to diversification. In this case, your arguing for higher returns to compensate for the asset’s risk-elevating contribution to a diversified portfolio.

One such company Lithium bank (which has lithium assets in Canada) is expected to IPO on the TSXV under the symbol $LBNK.V.

This project has an estimated 5.97M tonnes LCE, an average LI concentration of 67.1 mg/l and a total elemental Li recourse of 1.12M tonnes.

The price has been on the decline since their IPO last year and although I agree that they are not worth even close to what their IPO got pushed up to I do think that the result of the brutal beat down over the past year is not justified. 

 

Before we get too far into why i think its a good buy lets preface this with talking about why the stock fell after the latest earnings. During the last earnings release the company announced that during their fourth quarter of 2021 they experienced an unexpected high claims that pushed their EPS down to around $0.02 for the quarter. This was the second quarter in the fiscal year that had unexpectedly low earnings which resulted in severely depressed EPS for the year at $0.38. This is down over 80% from their previous years earnings. This decreased earnings paired with their CEO retiring after leading the company through 25 years of profit investors ran. But they ran too far…

 

The first positive thing I want to look at is the management and insiders of the company. Yes, the CEO did retire but he DID NOT LEAVE THE COMPANY. He is now the executive chairman on the board of directors. This means he will still be able to offer corporate governance to the new CEO despite being removed from day to day operations. Speaking about the new CEO, they hold a resume that is definitely nothing to shake a stick at. With over 15 years experience directly reporting to the prior CEO they have a good idea of how their particular business is run and i have full faith that they will be able to maintain the growth and stability that they have haad for the past 25 years. Looking further at the insiders you can see that there were a lot of sales by the insiders during the last quarter of 2021. This could have indicated the bad earnings however a good sign is that as soon as the stock dropped on the 9th and 10th insiders bought over 30,000 shares. In fact, since the start of 2022 no insider has sold any considerable amount of shares! 

 

Now i know what you are saying, who cares about the management show me the money! To that all i have to say is shut the f*** up and let me finish. After all if you have read this far your already past like 80% of the people on this sub who see a wall of text and move on to posts with cooler pictures. 

 

Looking at the financials of this company is where things start to get really exciting in my opinion. This company is PROFITABLE! Even with extremely high claims for the year they were still able to produce a profit from their received premiums. Looking at their premiums they were able to increase their written premiums by 30.9% this year and their gross revenue also increased by $12,239,000. Additionally they were able to increase the cash they received by operations by 88.67%. They spent a lot of this cash in their investment cash flow where they invested over double the cash that they made in operations. Yes, this did eat up some of their cash on hand and it does limit liquidity but we are living in a time of high inflation and having their money in investments instead of cash is actually better for retaining value. Additionally, their current ratio is still well over 1 with the spent cash so there is no worry in my mind of them running out of the over 100 million that they still have in cash. Their are several other indicators that i think show Trean will be successful within their financial statements but i will leave the rest of the digging up to you degenerates because im getting sick of typing.

>""Put on your bull glasses and SIMO gains"" - Dr. Doolittle, animal ophthalmologist

# KEY POINTS

* SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory
* Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside
* MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy
* Wave of Upcoming Catalysts
* Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery
* Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside)

# Company Description

Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues.

# Thesis

SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations.

This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4!

I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis:

This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering).

What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good.

More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no.

In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher.

Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). Qirh shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185.

https://preview.redd.it/pbczurua4kp81.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=491d7a7153a1235c8f4a5b84bda1aaf617e14924

Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace.

# Current Valuation & Financials

Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x

Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22

* Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value.

Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x

Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22

* These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth.
* This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP \[in PCIe Gen 5\] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs.
* Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed.

EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22

* You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product)

Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22

* Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept!
* Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21

Analyst Price Target: $110

* Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120.

# Technicals & Market Mechanics

SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector.

SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

# Upcoming Catalysts

Once again, a long list of event catalysts around the corner.

SIMO

* 3/23 Bank of America APAC TMT Conference 2022 (SIMO; potential pre-guide and/or capacity updates)
* 5/5 SIMO ER
* Now - 4/5, 5/6 - SIMO has expressed desire to accelerate their buyback program. Outside of the 30day pre-earnings blackout period, buybacks should kick in big time

Industry

* 3/23 U.S. Senate hearing on semis supply chain ""Developing Next Gen Tech for Innovation"", featuring execs from MU (25% revs) & INTC ($8.65% revs). Discussions will revolve around investment in Federal investment in semi mfg supply chains & America COMPETES Act 2022 & CHIPS for America Fund (potential $52bil to support US semi mfg fabs).

Key Supply Chain Ers (\~50% of Revs represented)

* 3/29 MU (25% Revs); this is THE biggest catalyst for SIMO, and thanks to current memory market dynamics, MU should have a total blowout
* 4/7 Samsung (3.3% Revs)
* 4/28 INTC (8.65% Revs)
* 4/28 Fujitsu (1.2% Revs)
* 4/28 SK Hynix (4.89% Revs)
* 4/29 WDC (4.23% Revs)
* 5/6 Arrow Electronics (2.2% Revs)

you might be thinking “when a lot of people sell stock and sentiment is low it goes down”. Well yeah, but the thing is, is that you can only sell to other buyers… if you cant connect to a buyer your stuck with your shares. Meaning that everyone who cant sell those shares STILL OWNS THOSE SHARES. These shares don’t just go into the abyss and disappear forever. 

 As far as my knowledge goes the company cannot actively change the price at which its shares are sold. the only time they can do this is during an IPO and from then on people determine the price.

If it were true that you could only sell to a buyer and not just get rid of your position then there would only be an upward trend in the market.

From Ant Financial to Jack Ma's disappearance to delisting issues to Chinese tech crackdowns and so on. Many of which did actually permanently change the health of the company itself.

However, it seems much of the more recent price drops have been due to fears that came out to be untrue.

&#x200B;

The biggest price drops in the recent year has been due to:

1. Delisting fears
2. Unending Chinese tech regulations
3. Trust of the entire VIE structure

It seems all of those are coming to be just that: fears.

**0. Fundamentals At A Glance**

I have no idea why this stock traded at $73 at one point (\~200 billion market cap) when the cash position alone is worth over a third of the market cap and its earnings are 22+ billion in a normal year. The company is still growing (albeit much less in % than it used to \[makes sense given how big the company is\]) and a money printing machine. Sure its margins are lowering due to investments in lower cost communities in China but that just means more profits long term. This company is a true cash machine.

**1. Delisting fears**

First of all, delisting does not mean the stock will go to zero. This might come off as a surprise to some people but with a reputable brokerage, you can exchange your 1 BABA shares to 8 XHKG:9988 shares. And you can vote with those 9988 shares.

Unless you suddenly came into the belief that China will nationalize all its stock exchange AND un-employ millions of Chinese grads who majored in finance/econ/etc., this idea is just baffling. Especially when China has been opening more stock exchanges recently: [Beijing Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Stock_Exchange) has opened just end of last year.

China has actually been taking steps the past year to support the concept of the stock market. And it seems Evergrande has been a life saving event for stock holders. The Evergrande fiasco has been one of the biggest bull cases for the Chinese govt to support the stock market as the place of investments for the younger generation over real estate. [Chinese stocks in surge after promise of state support](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/chinese-stocks-in-the-u-s-surge-after-promise-of-state-support)

As of actual delisting fears, all the commentaries from the Chinese side has been very bullish despite Bloomberg constantly claiming otherwise.

This year, the Chinese Govt has FINALLY made it public. Chinese tech stocks like Alibaba will BE allowed audits from the US. This is huge. Not only does this imply the accounting is credible for some of these big names, but it also means the entire delisting fear is just one big political play. [China plans audit concession](https://www.ft.com/content/0463c70d-4d24-4b9b-b7e5-ace22409d8e2)

So the entire 'delisting' issue should be off now. The very issue that has crashed majority of the value in Alibaba share price.

&#x200B;

**2. Unending Chinese tech regulations**

China has been different from the US in the tech market in that China opened its tech market with basically no laws. US on the other hand has laws in place ahead of time and then lets the companies compete.

And if are an East Asian, you would be well aware how toxic the private education industry has been to the people and how exploitive some of these tech giants have been becoming. Alibaba for instance with AlliPay was basically playing around with exploiting  the poor with loans to make profit. In the US, none of that would have happened. China however has been a developing nation and is finally starting to put rules in place for what tech should and shouldn't do.

All this led to fears of whether the Chinese Party hates the entire Chinese Tech industry or not. The crackdown seemed to be unending. Did China just hate all of big tech?

Well, the answer is now clear. The big tech regulation is ending. 

In October 2021, China hinted the crackdown for big tech was coming to an end: [news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-22/china-s-top-financial-regulator-sees-progress-in-tech-crackdown)

Very recently (last week), China officially declared tech crackdown was at closure: [news](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/china-says-it-will-support-chinese-ipos-abroad-calls-for-closure-on-tech-crackdown.html)

In fact, that news evidences China is supporting Chinese IPOs abroad on top too.

In other words, the entire big tech regulation fear is ending.

&#x200B;

**3. Trust of the entire VIE structure**

The ambiguity of the entire VIE structure and whether the Chinese govt would support it has been a huge ""?"" to the foreign investors for some time now.

Are VIE structure investing legit?

Well on end of December of 2021 (during Christmas time), China finally announced the verdict. VIE structures are a LEGITIMATE form of investing in Chinese firms. [VIE support](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/global-equity/china-tightens-loophole-for-companies-listing-abroad-15871357)

So that fear is entirely misplaced as now there's clarifications. All those decades of investors placing a discount on Chinese stocks BECAUSE of VIE structure should have been solved end of last year.

&#x200B;

**Bull information to consider**

The Chinese government has been proactively BUYING Chinese stocks since end of last year. Chinese firms have been proactively BUYING its own shares since end of last year.

Last time China endorsed its own companies to do buybacks proactively was the bottom of the financial crisis.

Alibaba has upped its share repurchase program to [$25 billion](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/alibaba-rises-as-much-as-11-after-the-chinese-e-commerce-giant-lifts-its-share-buyback-program-to-25-billion/ar-AAVlVV4?ocid=BingNewsSearch) claiming the price was not justifying the value of the company.

Why is it all the foreign investors in US are running away from Chinese stocks while both the Chinese government and the Chinese firms are throwing tens of billions at the Chinese stocks? Maybe just maybe the entire fear has been misplaced and the Western Media has been grossly overexaggerating all this?

And of course, it helps figureheads like Charlie Munger is also bullish on the stock and puts money where his mouth is. The financials of this company is phenomenal. It's a cash machine even without the growth story.

With the past 2 years of downturn, Alibaba shares have been more and more owned by Chinese investors. Add on with the buybacks, Alibaba shares will soon be traded by Chinese natives through Stock Connect. As of now (and in the past), Alibaba shares weren't traded by Chinese natives. That rule can soon change (in fact, the new buyback program alone is more than enough) as at least 55% of the company would now be traded in Hong Kong going forward. How is that not bullish? Alibaba stocks will soon be traded by BOTH foreigners AND domestic holders!",tk3mvm,0,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tk3mvm/alibaba_stock_the_steal_of_a_lifetime/

2595,"Long term vs short term, stocks and options",,"Just thought of something, please correct me if I’m wrong as I am a rookie. 

It seems like based on demographic and general vibe, options are what shorter term investors trade and stocks (meaning individual company stocks, mutual funds and ETF’s) are what longer term investors buy and hold. But I thought about it, and shouldn’t it be the opposite?

Short term options, due to their expiry dates, time decay, and volatility movements around earnings and <30 DTE are very unpredictable and can lose all their value very quickly. especially if they are OTM plays. 

If an investor is looking for a short term gain, wouldn’t simply buying and selling a stock be more suitable? Stocks will always be at fair market price based on supply and demand even after dramatic moves and theres no way your position value will go down despite you being correct about the direction of the stock (no IV crush). Also, if you are WRONG about the direction and it DOESN’T move the way you want to, you still (theoretically) and infinite amount of time to recover it with a stock purchase, but not with an options contract. The latter is likely to go to zero if its close to expiry

Mn the other hand, options (LEAPS) seem to be more suited for the “long term” (even though you can only go a maximum of 2 years+ out). having high leverage (delta > 60) on a trusted stock like AAPL or SPY or BRK that is very very unlikely to have two bad years in a row seems like the best case scenario. 

Is this a correct way of thinking? Or have I over-thought myself into thinking totally backwards? LOL",tjn945,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tjn945/long_term_vs_short_term_stocks_and_options/
2596,Return of Capital,,"I have a question on the taxation of return of capital distributions. I was looking at my 1099 for Realty Income (O) and see that ~70% of the dividend is return of capital so it is currently untaxed. 

From reading online, the return of capital does lower the tax basis so once I sell, it would affect my taxes once I sell. 

Is the main benefit then just that I can get the income now but hold on to the stock long enough to get the long term capital gain tax rate when I sell it? Am I also deferring the tax payment until later when I sell it?

Also, if I hold the stock for let’s say 5 years and there is a 3% return of capital every year, then eventually would that lower the tax basis by about 15%? So I’d be seeing a decent size taxable amount if I sell it after several years?

Also, in theory, should the stock price be affected by the return of capital distributions? Like the tax basis will go down and theoretically the stock price should go down by the same amount?

Just want to understand better the benefits of the return of capital distribution.",tjn4fm,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tjn4fm/return_of_capital/

2598,"Piedmont Lithium $PLL @ $49 A Steal, Rock Stock Channel Overview Shows $89 - $153 Fair Value for Just Carolina Lithium Project",Valuation,"\*\*\*Update: When the video came out Feb 9 '22 , $PLL was around $49. Today end of March '22, $PLL at $75\*\*\*

Howard and Rodney go over Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) and how ridiculously cheap this stock is from perceived mining permit headwinds (but CEO recently said ""nothing could be further from the truth"").

Highlights:

\-Stock has wallowed while other similar lithium stocks with the same or worse sovereign, technical, financial risks have soared and hit ATH

\-PLL only US domiciled fully SEC registered lithium developer. Could be included in Russell3000

\-Sum of parts EV/EBITDA shows Carolina Lithium alone would be $89 (50% NPV) to $150 (100% NPV).

\-Atlantic Lithium (LSE AIM: ALL) if trading like peers could be $800M USD market cap, where today $350M. PLL earn in of 50% of ALL means their stake alone is already significant towards own MC.

\-Offtake with Sayona Mining (ASX: SYS) and ALL more than doubled Piedmont’s spodumene supply to 500ktpy (equal to +75ktpy of lithium hydroxide).

\-Positive Cash flow for Piedmont from SYA’s NAL restart could come next year! (2023!) and increase with ALL online in 2024.

\-PLL if recovers to ATH $89 would be +80% from today’s $49 share price. At that ATH $89, market cap would be $1.4B, which is 70% NPV of Carolina Lithium alone (not counting SYA or ALL interest) and this NPV from DFS using conservative SC6 and LiOH sales price.

2599,Major Natural Gas Exposure Risk.,Fundamentals/DD,"We're all familiar with the craziness of the price of gas since the start of the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian War as much of Europe and America have been cutting ties with Russia. However, one of Russia's biggest trading partners is yet to cut off trade links and is still pumping literal tons of Russian gas through its pipes.

Ukraine itself.

Oh yes, the two neighbors are brother nations and cannot reasonably cut off all association from each other. It doesn't help that a lot of these pipes were built in the Soviet era when all major trade routes were intentionally passed through Russia.

So far, no gas infrastructure has been targeted during the war and Ukrainian gas companies claim to still control all major infrastructure. Even pieces of it taken by Russians are left intact because obviously they'd rather capture it.

There is still the risk major infrastructure may be destroyed by the war. Either unintentionally due to errant fire and/or loss of key workers or intentionally by Ukraine to prevent Moscow from having it.

In any case, I know a lot of people are betting on mean reversion thinking the price of gas will become rational after the bosses find new buyers/sellers.

2601,Savings all-in on stock market after buying a house,Advice Request,"I have a decent amount in savings in my mid-thirties. I'd like to invest it in ETFs that track broad market funds, diversifying between value, growth, developing world, and developed world, both EU, US, and other markets.

Bought a house with the bank's money at an interest rate of 1.50%, keeping my own money and planning to invest it to pocket the difference. In my country there is zero capital gains tax.

I'll be needing the money again in about 7 years.

The only risk seems to be that when the market collapses like in 2008, I can't sell for three something years. My monthly income and what I'll leave on the savings account should cover expenses, and budget for that worst-case scenario.

I have been speculating on the market for some months, and understand the fundamentals. I have limited experience with ETFs, so I plan on making a basket, taking fees into account (DEGIRO has a core selection without fees), and asking the opinions of some reputable contractors on UpWork.

A periodic buy seems like the best idea. But if I buy €2K worth each week for a year, I already miss out on gains from the start. Nonetheless, it'd also allow me to gradually buy in whilst getting to know the true cost of owning a property.

2619,What are the chances S&P500 index sees 3800 this year?,,"Sorry if this post is stupid. I know macroeconomic predictions are stupid but I also feel that this sort of falls closer to ""long term investing"" than it does ""daytrading/swing trading/momentum trading/technical analysis/guessing when + where the market is going at a micro level"".

We opened the year 4796 and we're at 4242, a 554 point/11.5% drop

To get to 3800 would be another 442 points downwards, which is 10% from where we are now (would be 20.7% overall)

We all knew that with the fed raising interest rates, stock valuations were due to come down. More expensive debt (if the company is using leverage/debt to grow, which most are?) = more revenue/income/cash flow spent on servicing debt = less profits posted each quarter = lower EPS. According to https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html, we will most likely see interest rates be within the range of 1.5% - 2.25% by December 2022. 

Oil seems to have come back down almost to pre-Russia/Ukraine war numbers. Light crude oil futures (CL1!) were at $92/barrel on February 24th. Currently sitting around $98 (down from their highs of $123). About a 6.5% increase. Granted, $92 wasn't a great price either, with oil mainly trading between $65-$85 for the year prior. If oil stays high... that's obviously an issue since it is responsible for so much of how the global economy works. 

Rising interest rates, high oil prices eating into consumer spending power, inflation as a whole eating into consumer spending power, geopolitical conflict in Ukraine/Russia, fed slowly tapering the amount of bond/MBS purchasing they have been doing to remove the extra liquidity + ""artificial propping up of value"" from those markets, residential real estate home supply crunch keeping most regular people away from being able to purchase a home, therefore increasing demand for rent, increasing rental prices as well.

If this subreddit allowed polls, I'd do a poll. What are the chances the markets hit 3800? A geopolitical war in Ukraine/Russia got us 11%... my thinking is... that's it?

Factored into New York’s annual State Budget, the zero-emissions fleet will be in the books by 2027. “The budget will enact a nation-leading commitment for New York to achieve the first fully zero-emission statewide school bus fleet in the country.”  
>  
>The state hopes to have all new bus purchases be electric and have zero emissions by 2027. By 2035, New York wants all buses in operation to be electric. The plan hopes to be able to use $500 million from the budget toward school bus electrification. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority will help the school districts finalize a plan and provide support as needed.

2629,Recover Bajaj Finance IEPF Unclaimed Shares,Discussion,"The IEPF was established by the Government of India to solve the growing problem of people forgetting their shareholdings in a firm. This initiative was established to defend investors' interests and raise awareness among them.

All iepf unclaimed shares & iepf unclaimed dividends and lost shares sent to IEPF on behalf of lawful shareholders are handled by the government. The biggest reason why shares go iepf unclaimed shares year after year is that individuals forget they hold them! How can anyone overlook their own investments?

***Here are some of the reasons why this occurs!***

* Investors frequently fail to select a candidate for their shares. The heirs are unaware of any such ownership. Finally, the shares are abandoned.
* Because the amount invested in shares is little, investors tend to overlook it.
* In certain situations, the shares become embroiled in legal processes as a result of property disputes. In such cases, the shares stay ownerless until the ultimate court decision.

**Before IEPF**

Whenever the IEPF was not implemented, firms contributed iepf unclaimed shares iepf unclaimed dividends and shares to government funds. This money was utilised by the government for a variety of public welfare programmes. The monies were also utilised for a number of development projects.

Subsequently, the government recognised the heavy losses incurred by investors and decided to establish the IEPF. This functioned as a forum for investors to contact the government in order to claim their payouts. They can even get their long-forgotten shares refunded. The IEPF allowed investors to obtain dividends and shares directly from the fund management. All they had to do was make an application to the controlling authority. Instead of contacting each firm separately, people may now claim their dividends and shares from several companies through a single site.

## IEPF Unclaimed Shares & [IEPF Unclaimed Dividend](https://muds.co.in/recovery-shares-iepf/) Transferred to IEPF

***So, what happening to the shares and dividends that have been transferred to the IEPF? Will investors lose their rights to their iepf unclaimed dividends and*** [***iepf unclaimed shares***](https://muds.co.in/recovery-shares-iepf/)***?***

The dividend sum and shares were handed to the government prior to the creation of the IEPF. As a result, a shareholder lost all rights to the dividend money. The establishment of the IEPF enabled owners to retain control over the dividend amount and shares transferred to the IEPF Account. A simple application to the IEPF's fund management will assist in keeping these privileges.

Reputable firms, such as Bajaj Finance Ltd., send individual letters, by post, and through numerous other forms of contact to inform shareholders of their stake in the company. Their staff will remind stockholders to file their dividend claims on time. Once shares have been moved to the IEPF, the procedure of reclaiming them may become difficult.

The fund manager's entire refund procedure is time-consuming. To guarantee that the reimbursement reaches the correct owner, all applications are thoroughly reviewed. As a result, Bajaj Finance Ltd. advises shareholders to collect the dividend directly from the firm. The procedure is simple and quick. To claim dividends, shareholders must submit an application to the Company's Registrar or Transfer Agent.

If the shares have already been transferred to the IEPF, simply approach the company's Nodal Officer. You can contact the appropriate authority through email.",u2knsd,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/u2knsd/recover_bajaj_finance_iepf_unclaimed_shares/
2630,$LOW vs $HD and their option contract prices,Discussion,"It appears $LOW has dropped 22.47% and $HD has dropped 27.18% from their respective 52 week highs. Given the inflated stock market during COVID, the current inflation, and the increasing interest rates, I’d assume these stocks would be dropping faster since all these factors seem to work against both stocks. 

Assuming my previous assumption is correct, I’d buy puts on either company but the put contracts are so expensive when considering their weekly movements so it doesn’t seem worth it.

If someone could help me out by answer the following questions or giving their perspective, I’d greatly appreciate it.

(1) Why would you pick $LOW over $HD?
(2) Why are these stocks not dropping faster when inflation and interest rates are both increasing (which I’d assume would hurt business)?

JPMorgan Chase & Co . is a global financial services company. The company operates in four segments: consumer & community banking ( CCB ), corporate & investment bank ( CIB ), commercial banking ( CB ) and asset & wealth management ( AWM ).

&#x200B;

U.S. banks face huge earnings losses. First-quarter profit expectations for major banks have been cut considering the Russia sanctions and a severe slowdown in business activity.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is the 17th most popular stock among hedge funds, according to a study by ClearBridge Investments. JPMorgan was in 107 hedge fund portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 101 in the previous quarter. Even with the increasing interest from institutional investors, the stock has lost about -20% in the last 3 months!

Insiders believe ""JPMorgan Chase is too big to fail"". JPMorgan is indeed an influencing giant of the financial world, but a share price recovery also depends on the global economy and its recovery.

After googling I found this AMZA,  ETFIS SER TR I INFRACAP MLP ETF NEW. 

I bought via vanguard and haven't put much in, but i'm confused to all hell. So it turns out to be an energy ETF, but used to be worth 100/share but now is 15/share? Did energy tank during that time? 

It seems to be doing well since I invested, but now that I know it isn't what I thought it was, I'm not sure to let it ride longer or move it to what I thought was modern surgery. 

My main question is if anyone can explain why it went from 100/share to 13/share, and why it seems to be doing well now. I know it is energy but a 90% reduction on an ETF seems odd. Also vanguard seems to have like no history on it.

2652,Likelihood of Stock Borrow charges?,Newbie,"The following warning shows on Merrill Edge:

**As a reminder, if you short a security that is in limited supply (i.e., ""in demand""), you may be assessed a Stock Borrow (SB) charge for borrowing that security. Currently, this security does not have a SB charge associated with it. However, if the security becomes ""in demand"" after settlement and the short position remains open you may be charged a SB charge. Whether there is a SB charge for a particular security, and the relevant rate for the SB charge, may change daily. SB charges may be significant enough to exceed the principal value of the security on an annualized basis.**

**You may request updated information for your short positions (including any applicable SB charges) at any time by contacting your financial advisor or Merrill Representative.**

*****

# [S&P 500 futures rise slightly following two-day Fed sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly on Thursday as the market tried to recover from back-to-back losing sessions, while traders digested the Federal Reserve’s plans to tighten monetary policy.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat, S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.2%.
*****
> Shares of HP Inc surged 15% in the premarket after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a stake in the tech hardware maker.
*****
> The Fed on Wednesday released the minutes from its March meeting, which showed that officials planed to reduce their trillions in bond holdings with a consensus amount around $95 billion. Meanwhile, policymakers indicated that one or more 50 basis-point interest rate hikes could be warranted to battle surging inflation.
*****
> “The minutes from the latest FOMC meeting portray a higher level of urgency than previous communication as the Fed has circled on a commitment to run the balance sheet down faster than market participants may have expected,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management.
*****
> Officials “generally agreed” that a maximum of $60 billion in Treasurys and $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities would be allowed to roll off, phased in over three months and likely starting in May.
*****
> The news sent the blue-chip Dow down more than 100 points Wednesday, while the S&P 500 slid 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped another 2.2%, bringing its week-to-date losses to 2.6%. Those losses came after comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard pushed stock prices lower on Tuesday.
*****
> “It does seem like they are talking up the possibility of raising rates by 50 basis points at the next meeting so the hope is that message is well telegraphed in advance,” said Brian Price, head of investment management at Commonwealth Financial Network. “I expect that volatility will remain elevated for the time being as there is a lot of uncertainty for investors to digest right now.”
*****
> Investors await the weekly jobless claims data Thursday morning, which is expected to show a total of 200,000 claims filed.
*****
> Investors also continue to monitor the Ukraine-Russia war, as Ukraine asks NATO for more weapons.
*****
> “Ukraine’s urgent needs, the sustainability of supplies, and long-term solutions which will help Ukraine to prevail,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet.
*****
> Crude prices ticked higher after falling in the previous session. U.S. oil gained 0.7% to $96.94 per barrel, while international Brent advanced 0.9% to $101.95.

2658,How does insider information work in regards to options and stock splits?,,"Hey Stocks folks,

let's assume someone gets insider information on a stock (AAPL in this example) which is currently at 171 USD, and the one getting the information somehow thinks, because of the insider information, the stocks value would be around 1000 USD somewhere between June and September 2022.

&#x200B;

The one getting the insider information has a budget of 10,000 USD

&#x200B;

A) What would be the best option he could buy, if he would be convinced of his bet?

B) What would happen in case the stock splits after he buys his options, do they split as well?

&#x200B;

I know those kind of bets are a bad idea and should not be done, I'm more interested in the perfect crime scenario.

I have been searching extensively for ways to invest in India's economic growth.

I researched all the ETFs, actively managed, passively managed, CEFs, Emerging market ETFs, all of them.

However, none of them were a match for me, as most of them seem to have been trading sideways for decades and India's market PE ratio is also indication some overvaluation.

After being stuck in this paradox for weeks, I have stumbled upon india's largest bank: HDFC bank.

It has a pretty smooth upward trend and good fundamentals on paper.

I would like to hear your opinions on this bank, is it a good long term bet on India's economy?

Do you guys know of a better way to invest in India's growth?

**Quick question:**  
I wanted to have some shares from the **T Spin-off** and wanted to buy some shares before before the record date. Now i just read an article, that said the record date was on **April 4. 2022**. So basically yesterday!

Did i really just miss the date by one day or is it still possible to buy today, since i also read another part where it says:  ""**The record date for the stock dividend is the close of business on April 5, 2022**""

Does anyone know better? Cause i'm confused now and would not buy T if the record date has already happened, since the price after that spin-off will drop for adjustment. So i would really appreciate a good and quick response.

Thank you upfront.",twrlw9,0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/twrlw9/buy_att_t_today_on_april_5/

Currently they are sitting around the $10.00 mark but they also have warrants which are sitting at the $3.00 mark. I have the basic concepts of how warrants work - you have the ability to buy x number of shares at the warrant price at a later date but I don’t know the full extent of how this operates. 

If I were to buy say 1000 warrants at 3.00 (instead of at the stock value of $10.00), if the stock price rises to $30.00, what’s the process here for exercising my warrant?

2676,How to Claim Shares from IEPF?,Discussion,"We'll help you reclaim your iepf claim or iepf unclaimed shares. Some of MUDS's most well-known services are listed below.

**How to claim shares from iepf?**

1. **Transmission of shares (iepf unclaimed shares)**

It is the act of transporting a share from the original owner to a claimant or legal heir by operation of law, for reasons such as insolvency, death, marriage, lunacy, or any other valid reason other than natural transfer.

The claimant or legal heir becomes the rightful holder of the shares after the shares are successfully transmitted. Individuals with such shares are also entitled to the rights that come with them.

***The conventional documentation for the transmission of shareholdings is listed below:***

* For stock transfer, there is a prescribed application form.
* a legitimate copy of the authentic holder's death certificate
* Letter of Administration, Probate of Will, or Succession Certificate
* Petitioner's signature, legal heir's signature, or successor's signature PAN copy 

1. **Transfer of shares is the second facility**

The intentional transfer of title of the claims between the transferor and the transferee is referred to as a transfer of shares. The transferor's liability vanishes after this process is completed, and the shares are routed to the recipient. The transfer deed is the instrument used in the transfer of shares.

1. **Transfer of unclaimed dividends is the third service** 

When a company makes a profit, the profit available to shareholders is referred to as dividends. The value of a dividend is determined by the number of shares a shareholder owns in the company. As previously stated, [iepf unclaimed shares](https://muds.co.in/recovery-shares-iepf/) **&** dividends are routed to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) account if they remain unclaimed for seven consecutive years. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has given shareholders the option of reclaiming such securities.

**What is the Investor Education and Protection Fund's function?**

The Investor Education and Protection Fund is a federal repository for unclaimed stock, dividends, and bonus issues. SEBI and MCA, for example, allow shareholders of such securities to recoup their losses through a well-defined protocol.

The recovery of securities can become a little more complicated in the case of common pitfalls, as mentioned above. As a result, holders of such securities should exercise caution or seek professional advice to ensure a smooth recovery.

**MUDS is a one-stop shop for top-notch legal and consulting services. Our professionals are tasked with providing clients with bespoke and high-quality services based on their needs.**

**Dematerialization OF Physical Shares**

The method of transforming physical assets into electronic form is known as the dematerialization. Because the transfer of physical shares is prohibited by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India), this makes the investments tradable. Investors face a variety of issues with physical investments, including signature mismatch, name change, and a variety of other issues, and we offer comprehensive solutions to all of these issues as well as assistance in dematerializing physical shares.

**Reclaiming Investments transferred to IEPF**

If shares, dividends, or mutual funds are not claimed for seven years in a row, they are transferred to the iepf claim. We specialise in assisting individuals in recovering their IEPF shares, and we have recovered millions of dollars in iepf claim  shares over the years.

Normally, the entire process of [iepf claim  share recovery](https://muds.co.in/recovery-shares-iepf/) takes a long time and effort, but with our expertise, we can complete it in the shortest time possible while also covering all of your unclaimed investments.",tvvvk1,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tvvvk1/how_to_claim_shares_from_iepf/
2677,Leave my Funds in Traditional EJ Advisor Account vs Move to Robo Advisor?,,"Greetings Friends.

I am in need of advice on what my best course of action is here. I have an Edward Jones account that had been created by a relative when I was a child. She invested in it regularly as Christmas and birthday gifts for years while I was growing up. She passed away a few years ago, and I am now graduating from college and beginning my career. I have not done anything with the account since she passed, and to be frank, neither has the advisor managing it.

I have between 5-10k in the account, so I understand that it is not a large priority for the advisor. I am wondering if I am better off liquidating that account and reinvesting that money into either a Vanguard Digital Advisor or Schwab Robo Advisor that will have lower fees, a more diverse portfolio, and be more actively managed. I am looking for long term growth with a moderate to high risk.

2678,Regular Account to Retirement Account Wash Sale,,"Hi, 

As far as I understand, when you sell a security at a loss and buy it back within 30 days you can not count the loss on taxes for that year, but have to wait until next year. A way that brokers 'balance the books' (I use Merrill Edge) is by increasing the cost basis of the repurchased share by the loss amount. 

If I were to sell my shares at a loss and repurchase them in my Roth IRA account I will also incur a wash sale penalty, but how will the loss be accounted for if the shares are in my retirement account, and thus their cost basis does not matter for taxing purposes?",tvhoot,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tvhoot/regular_account_to_retirement_account_wash_sale/
2679,Exercising Stock Options Math (help),,"For the life of me, I can't understand how this math is meant to work, so I'm hoping someone can explain it me.

So here's the scenario: I have received stock options from work - let's say I can exercise 10 shares at $20 per share.  Cool, we're starting at $200 to purchase.  However! I needed to wait a year for the options to vest, and even though I can buy 10 for $20, the current stock price is $30.  It looks like I'm getting taxed on that $10 difference as an additional fee (this is via eTrade, in case that's relevant).

2 years later, the stock price is now $50 a share and I decide to sell my 10 shares for a ""profit"" of $300 ($50 - $20)\*10, and then come April those $300 get taxed as long-term capital gains.

Here is my question - it certainly looks like I was taxed twice - once for hypothetical, unrealized gains when first exercising those stock options, and then taxed a second time on actual gains when those stocks were later sold.  Is that accurate?  What is going on here?

Situation: Last month (28 Feb) I sold 1 put option Apple @ 150 that expires today (1 Apr), cashed in 204 USD of premium. Today Apple trades @ 173, and the premium to close this contract (buy 1 put) is 0.34.

Since yesterday my broker displays it as a 100% return, (due to rounding) - obviously it was an extra day till expiration, but Apple was higher.

Is there any reason why I should wait till expiration instead of closing it right now?

~~In both cases~~ When closing prematurely I will pay a tiny commission (expiration OTM is free). If I wait till expiration I will ""benefit"" from an extra $0.34 of the premium. If I close now, I won't risk any flash crash and it will release my margin so I can sell more puts.

>Thursday, March 31, 2022  
>  
>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) was in a bind on Monday.  
>  
>Its currency, the yen, was crashing while yields on their government bonds were surging. The solution — [four days of unbridled bond buying](https://www.yahoo.com/video/forex-dollar-hits-6-high-194529413.html) by the BOJ to stem the hemorrhaging and contain interest rates. While the gambit worked (for now), Wall Street is waking up to this potential canary in the coal mine.  
>  
>Big moves in the yen are rare, but traders pay attention when the currency starts moving. It's the third most heavily-traded currency, and it's involved in trillions of dollars worth of highly levered trades. Hedge funds try to arbitrage differences in interest rates around the world by borrowing in ""cheap"" currencies (like the yen) and investing in bonds in higher-yielding countries — the so-called [carry trade](https://www.investopedia.com/carry-trade-definition-4682656).  
>  
>For instance, if 10-year Australian bonds yield 5% while similar Japanese bonds are paying close to nothing, investors can sell the yen, buy the Australian dollar, and use the proceeds to buy Australian bonds. There are lots of moving parts and wonky details, but that's the gist of it.  
>  
>But because traders are essentially picking up dimes in front of a bulldozer, these bets are highly levered to maximize returns — which means they can fall apart quickly and cause systemic risk if enough traders are effected.  
>  
>So when the yen starts making big upward or downward moves, traders face tough decisions. Hedge funds staring down the barrel of multiple margin calls will liquidate good bets — even safe haven assets like gold — to cover their bad bets. This is how contagion works.  
>  
>For now, the BOJ's bond buying — effectively printing more money, in this case yen — is supporting easy financial conditions. But if the bank's hand is forced and it abandons the buying, a massive unwinding will likely follow. And no one is currently pricing in this risk.  
>  
>Since the yen is being used as a cheap source of funds to leverage the carry trade, it's a risky bet, points out [Bloomberg's John Authers](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-28/japan-and-the-yen-find-a-new-way-to-market-relevancy-in-era-of-war-and-inflation?sref=eeq6exxF). Everyone is piling on the same side of the trade such that it becomes self-fulfilling. But the yen has also historically functioned as a flight-to-safety haven during times of stress. If that relationship reasserts and the yen strengthens materially, it's game over for those playing the carry.  
>  
>""Far from offering sanctuary from the world’s strife, Japan is being treated once more as an ATM to fund risk-taking elsewhere,"" Authers wrote.  
>  
>While the yen and Japanese bond market have cooled for now, the BOJ will have a big decision to make. Further pressure could lead Japanese authorities to intervene in the yen. Japan has a long and storied history of weakening the yen to favor their exports. But this would be the first time since 1998 that the bank would [intervene to strengthen the currency](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/japan-weaker-yen-may-not-be-blessing-it-once-was-2021-11-26/).  
>  
>Surging commodity costs is currently the biggest factor. Japan is a huge energy importer, which depresses its currency as the yen is sold to buy oil and gas (and food and everything else) at higher prices. This outweighs the benefit of boosting their exports as their goods become cheaper abroad — especially as Japan has offshored a lot of its manufacturing over the last decade.

>A plummeting yen also puts upward pressure on interest rates, which is at odds with the BOJ's policy of controlling the entire yield curve. (By way of reference, the Federal Reserve only seeks to influence short-term U.S. rates.) If the BOJ is forced to abandon its yield curve control strategy, that brings the yen devaluation option to the forefront.  
>  
>The other dynamic at play is the strengthening Chinese yuan, or renminbi, which is dangerously close to approaching the very level versus the yen that caused authorities in China to [devalue its currency by 3% in 2015](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/chinese-devaluation-yuan/). That surprise move upended global risk markets and sent many stock markets around the world plunging into bear territory.  
>

By which I mean I just basically set it and forget after I buy. I’ve never done any trading as I am only 20 and I am looking for long term returns. My portfolio is majority VTI as well as 2 other ETFs. Lately though will all the noise in the market around inflation and potential “mini-recession”, I have been researching and looking at some good ETFs to pick up to hedge some of the inflation/poor economy over the next 5 to 8+ years. Today I picked up XLE (Energy sector fund), VNQ (real estate fund) and XLF (financials sector fund). I know Reddit is not going to be my main source of advice but I did want to hear any advice anyone has on here? What do you think some good ETFs would be for the next 3 years? Any thoughts on the ETFs I picked up today. I’ve been researching for the past few weeks and have made a list but any new picks or ideas I would greatly appreciate. Also I should mention that I only buy ETFs, I plan on eventually buying individual stocks once I accumulate more capital and am able to focus a bit more time into the market. And lastly, I know the economy could easily recover and inflation may be slowed down significantly, as nobody can predict the market but I am just looking to trade right now based off what I have noticed may happen in the coming 3 years. 

*Note: I know I said good ETFs for the next 3 years, I know that’s a really short time frame. I’m not looking to cash out or make huge gains, I mainly just want a fund that hopefully won’t decrease too much in value.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/facebook-tiktok-targeted-victory/?utm_campaign=mb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew

I have serious doubts as to the competence of FB’s Zuckerberg. It is clear that Zuckerberg has no creative innovative plays in his pocket. Instagram was an app developed by someone not affiliated with FB, which FB purchased and ran with. IG Stories was a concept stolen from Snap, Inc. IG Reels was a concept stolen from TikTok. FaceBook is decaying. The metaverse is a speculative play principally enabled by corporations (think Dolce and Gabbana, Tommy, Forever 21).

Having said this, I give credence to what Professor Damodaran has said ( https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2022/02/back-to-earth-or-temporary-setback.html?m=1 ) about FB being massively cheap right now. I would purchase FB if in the next one or two financial statements they report attractive net income.

2699,ISO online brokerage for buying international stocks (US investor),Resources,"I'm looking for online brokerage suggestions, based on my situation.

* I'm in the US.
* I plan to trade at most one a year.
* I plan to buy risky stocks and hold for a long time (I'm willing and able to lose 100% of the money I invest).
* I want to maximize flexibility when it comes to the type of stock I can buy (different countries, different exchanges, different regulatory situations, whatever).
* Because I don't plan to trade often, I don't care very much about the trading interface, trading hours, and stuff like that.
* I don't care about trading on margin or trading in derivatives; I don't really even care that much about trading any assets other than stocks.
* I am fairly paranoid about the idea of my broker screwing me, or getting hacked, or facing some regulatory issues that mess me up, or something like that, so institutional reputation and stability are important to me.

So basically my priorities are #1 variety, #2 reputation, #3 low per-transaction cost for large transactions.

So even though I bought back in at $225.27 per share, it now shows my cost basis on those shares as $238 / share because of the wash sale.

2702,PUBM looks interesting to me,," 

TL/DR Pubmatic is a buy IMO

Pubmatic has seen its revenue rise consistently for the past four years. Even so, PubMatic shares are trading around $26 at the time of this writing, far below their 52-week high of $76.96. A key factor impacting the stock price is the massive change happening in the digital advertising industry.

With Apple and Google changing the way consumers are tracked, there is a lot of FUD around the online advertising business but IMO this creates a buying opportunity. I’m not going to try to convince you guys that I have a firm grasp on this business. Instead I’m going to regurgitate a bunch of stuff that I read on Motley Fool and Creating Alpha.

PubMatic's cloud-based advertising platform helps content creators, called publishers, efficiently sell the ad space appearing alongside their website and app content. In return, publishers pay fees to PubMatic. By catering to publishers, PubMatic obtains first-party data about the audiences viewing this content for use in its platform. So while Google's impending ad targeting changes, set to happen next year, may hurt ad tech firms reliant on Google's data, PubMatic will largely maintain the targeting insights needed to deliver results to clients. In the first full quarter after Apple changed their privacy policy PUBM recorded record revenue with a 54% increase yoy.

Revenue grew 15% in 2019, 31% in 2020 and 54% in 2021. Now if you’ve read this far you get to hear the kicker. This is a high growth company but get this: THEY MAKE MONEY! And the amount that they make has been steadily growing. In 2021 their fully diluted EPS was $1.00 so they are trading at a p/e of about 26 and a price/sales of 8.5. These numbers are unheard of for a growth company like this. Compare them to TTD (not really a competitor but in the same business) with p/e of 249 and price to sales of 38.18 and I think this is a steal.

Position: short 10 x $40 PUBM puts 01/23 and long $12.50 PUBM calls 01/23 also, because I like to buy an industry, short: 10 x $22.50 MGNI puts 01/23 and long $7.50 MGNI calls 01/23.",tsk4zf,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tsk4zf/pubm_looks_interesting_to_me/

&#x200B;

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 30, 2022 /[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ -- To drive significantly greater productivity and efficiency for increasingly complex chip designs, [Synopsys, Inc](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3488542-1&h=1651473269&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.synopsys.com%2F&a=Synopsys%2C+Inc). (Nasdaq: [SNPS](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3488542-1&h=26892142&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.synopsys.com%2Fcompany%2Finvestor-relations.html&a=SNPS)) today announced a new cloud-optimized electronic design automation (EDA) deployment model that delivers unparalleled levels of chip and system design flexibility via a single-source, pay-as-you-go approach. Synopsys Cloud provides access to the company's cloud-optimized design and verification products, with pre-optimized infrastructure on Microsoft Azure to address higher levels of interdependencies in chip development.  

""Semiconductor companies are increasingly challenged to quickly deliver both complex functionality and energy efficiency to meet growing requirements for more compute,"" said Mark Papermaster, executive vice president and CTO, AMD. ""AMD is delivering high-performance processors across a wide range of workloads. Innovative approaches like Synopsys Cloud built on the Microsoft Azure HBv3 cloud platform – now powered by the latest 3rd Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors with 3D V-Cache™ technology – can provide access to optimized compute and EDA tools in the cloud, further adding to our innovative chip design capabilities.""

**Flexibility to Address Dynamic Chip Design and Verification Workloads**

Chip development in the cloud represents a way forward for an industry grappling with exploding computational demands along with continued time-to-market pressure. From innovative design houses to large systems companies to small startups, more chipmakers are migrating workloads to the cloud to take full advantage of the faster time-to-results, enhanced quality-of-results and better cost-of-results that cloud-based design and verification technologies provide. It has, however, become more challenging to forecast compute needs, leading engineers to underestimate the compute and EDA resources they need while experiencing growing systemic complexity.

**Collaboration with Microsoft Azure to Enhance Chip Development with SaaS Approach**

In recent years, chip development teams began leveraging a ""bring your own cloud"" (BYOC) approach offered by Synopsys and other EDA vendors, where chip development teams are required to source compute infrastructure from public cloud service providers and are frequently constrained by pre-defined design and verification capacity. Synopsys is working closely with its preferred cloud partner, Microsoft, to transform the landscape through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) chip development solution on the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform. With the SaaS approach, customers can directly access and pay as they go for cloud compute resources and for any Synopsys cloud-enabled design and verification product.

Customers who already have cloud resources through a BYOC model can also take advantage of Synopsys Cloud and its pay-per-use cloud-enabled EDA tools. The collaboration with Microsoft Azure will enable design teams to benefit from flexibility and faster time-to-market, addressing today's systemic complexities in chip design and verification. [Read more](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3488542-1&h=824083799&u=https%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Faccelerate-silicon-design-innovation-on-azure-with-synopsys-cloud&a=Read+more) from Microsoft about this collaboration and its benefits.

**Streamlining the Foundry Collateral Process**

Synopsys is working together with major foundries to streamline access to required manufacturing collateral for use with its cloud-optimized products. The roadmap for the collaboration aims to provide customers with a flexible, cloud-optimized approach for accessing and managing foundry collateral.

""Our new Synopsys Cloud offering promises to be transformative, providing designers the ability to scale up or down in response to their dynamic chip design and verification needs,"" said Sassine Ghazi, president and chief operating officer at Synopsys. ""As more design flows incorporate AI, requiring even more resources, the virtually unlimited compute and EDA access we're providing will lay the foundation for new levels of semiconductor innovation while delivering a flexible, secure chip development environment for future demands.""

Rani Borkar, Corporate Vice President, Azure Hardware Systems & Infrastructure at Microsoft added, ""Addressing systemic complexity along with interdependent design flows in chip design requires more compute and EDA resources than ever before. Microsoft Azure continues to scale its high-performance computing infrastructure with the availability, affordability and capacity to handle advanced chip design and verification workloads. The Synopsys Cloud software-as-a-service solution has been purpose-built on Microsoft Azure for EDA workloads, delivering a flexible design and verification environment to foster the productivity that design teams need.""",ts9hoc,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ts9hoc/synopsys_launches_industrys_first_broadscale/

GameStop — Shares of the video game retailer dropped 6% on huge trading volume. More than 8 million shares traded through 10:50 a.m. ET, already doubling its 30-day average full-day volume of 4.6 million. There were some large block trades of GameStop in early trading on the NYSE.

Nielsen Holdings – Shares spiked about 20% following news that a group of private equity investors led by Brookfield Business Partners will acquire the ratings company for $16 billion. The company had previously rejected a $9 billion offer from the same group.

2708,Borrowing with collateral?,Discussion,"I am not really informed about the new unrealized gains tax bill that is talked about and economics in general but some people have the argument that you can’t tax unrealised gains because it would force billionaires to sell stock and lower share value. 

This makes sense in my head.

The counter argument is : if you can’t taxe unrealised gains you should not be able to borrow with stock as collateral because you are borrowing on assets that are not realized and not taxed. 

This does not make sense in my head.

If you borrow money with stock as collateral you would eventually need to pay tax when you sell stock to pay your debt. 

I don’t know if it’s possible but if you can directly transfer stock to a bank they would need to buy it at a discount price because they need to pay tax when they sell. 

If you die with all the stock I assume stock will get automatically sold to repay debt and in consequence pay tax and if stocks are transferred to children they would need to pay hereditary tax.

So I am not trying to criticize any view but I would like know where my train of thinking is wrong .

Wanted to get some opinions here. I recently (finally) put some money into the market with inflation being what it is. I own a variety of ETFs, murual funds and a bit of individual stocks. My question obviously pertains to VOO here.

When comparing SPY and VOO, you'll notice they are virtually identical. The biggest differences are expense ratio (VOO wins) and option volume (SPY wins).

My question is, I would assume most long term holders that plan onto DCAIng into the market gradually to hold long term will choose VOO due to the lower expense ratio. Do you think that, a ways down the road, option volume will approach what SPY is currently at? I would love to ultimately start selling covered calls. If it's likely VOO option volume will increase, I'll continue with VOO, but if not I may consider closing the position and averaging in to SPY instead.

2726,Boxed positions in TOS and am I missing something here?,,"So I just noticed that boxed positions (both long and short) is available in TOS, and when checking with TOS trade desks, they seem to not like the idea of it, saying that it wont provide any real profits, because whichever direction it moves, it will do nothing but use buying powers provided that it's 1:1 ratio to both long and short.

True, but if timing is right, then it can give more benefits?

I give them specific examples, where stock A is traded at 100$ per shares on 9 AM. Then at 10 AM, this stock crashed to 90$ per shares, where I covered the short positions.

Then, later at 11 AM, it skyrocketed to 110$, so I sold long positions to close. In both ways, I could make 10$ per profits for each directions.

True, the reality will be really complicated enough that the odd will be not happening like this scenario, where just because I buy to close (covering the short position at 90) doesnt mean it can't crash even further to 80 (let's just say this numbers), so I would be still 10$ per share net negative if that occurs, but at the end of days, stock will go up should the stock valuation is right around 110$ per shares.

Like if I dont mind it holding it for a while until it goes up to 110$, which is my target price.

Typically, when I long on position, it goes down for next couple of days, but if I can open boxed positions, then it will help to offset some losses (when I covered the short).

Sure, there will be margin maintenance and interest fees, and I dont mind it costing some extra fees, but is there something wrong in this scenarios? They keep saying that there is no real benefits whatsoever, but more disadvantages for the fees and margin maintenance, not to mention buying powers, which I totally agree to.

After talking to them, I feel like I am missing something here?",togf16,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/togf16/boxed_positions_in_tos_and_am_i_missing_something/

2732,V2G Tech Bridging The Gap Between EV and Diesel Cost In an Untapped Market,,"Full disclosure: I retained a small position in $PTRA in my Roth IRA. Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD as always.

I want to start a discussion on **V2G** as I think it has reached the turning point in commercialization of V2G tech and its unique but perfect marriage with electric school bus.

&#x200B;

**What is V2G:**

V2G or Vehicle-to-Grid is using electric vehicle specially equipped with bidirectional charging to take energy from the grid when the cost is low such as overnight and selling the energy back to the grid during peak hours when the electric cost is highest. It is important that the EV has a lot of energy left, ie: short routes and mostly unused hours/days. School buses have short routes, spend most of the day not in use and have many months without service particularly in the Summer assuming 180 days in a typical school year. Most electric vehicles can't do V2G. For example, not only my Tesla can't do bidirectional charging due to limitation, even if it could there just isn't enough 'juice' left to sell back to the grid at the end of the day because of high mileage.

&#x200B;

**Successful use of V2G in commercial settings:**

Thomas Built Buses just announced a [long term agreement](https://electrek.co/2022/03/18/electric-school-buses-are-reaching-cost-parity-with-diesel-and-a-california-district-will-deploy-one-of-the-largest-e-bus-fleets-in-the-state/) to 2025 with Highland Electric to sell a fleet of the electric bus Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley powered by Proterra's 226kWh battery and drivetrain. The 226kWh battery is the largest in the industry for school buses and has the capacity that is more than 16 times that of a Tesla Powerwall battery. This agreement is expanding on their previous fleet order of 326 electric bus in February of 2021 after Highland spent the past year successfully confirming that it is profitable using V2G on the Jouley electric school bus. [Highland estimated that a single bus generated roughly $10,000 for the company over the course of the summer](https://environmentnorthcarolinacenter.org/sites/environment/files/reports/NC_V2G%202022%20scrn.pdf#NC_V2G%202022.indd%3A11654) performing V2G. Highland will finance the purchase of the electric bus fleet, charge the Jouley bus overnight when cost is cheapest, [have the school districts pay on subscriptions for just the miles driven](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/03/21/sbaas-model-brings-electric-school-buses-to-more-districts/), then sell the leftover energy back to the grid during peak hours when the cost is highest. Highland would take care of all maintenance and charging infrastructure. Highland Electric is a company that was created for the sole purpose of commercializing V2G in electric school buses. It's doing this for profit. The result came back so promising that it resulted in them opening their order book for more.

&#x200B;

**Why is this important:**

Having a working business model where it is profitable to buy an electric school bus vs diesel is a game changer. An electric school bus is no longer viewed as just a novelty transport but as a stack of 16 Tesla Powerwalls that just happen to also earn transport income. Cost has always been the biggest hurdle in transitioning from 480,000 diesel school buses to electric. Electric school bus is often priced $120,000-$200,000 higher than its comparable diesel school bus. I'm fully aware of the few billions in funding for new electric school buses in a use-it-or-lose-it mandate and the touted $10,000 or so per year savings on fuel and maintenance. But unless the upfront cost comes down to the same level as diesel, I don't see many of those diesel getting phased out to electric. Having companies like Highland Electric take on the upfront cost and the associated long term risk would get transition to electric sped up and on a massive scale. The fact that Highland found long term, V2G not only make up the difference in $120,000-$200,000 cost difference but actually turning a profit from it is extremely intriguing. Now, for the same amount of money, school districts can get 3 electric school buses instead of 1 by having Highland maximizing the full potential of these powerful batteries instead of having them waste away in the parking lot in down time.

&#x200B;

**More companies want in on V2G:**

Aside from Thomas Built Buses long-term partnership using Proterra's 226kWH battery and drivetrain with Highland Electric, a number of other companies are taking advantage of the working V2G & electric school bus model.

\- Dominion Energy selected Thomas Built's Jouley electric bus with its 226 kWh Proterra battery for V2G ([source](https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10133648/bus-electrification-partnership-to-drive-cost-savings-cleaner-air)). Dominion plans to add 200 buses per years for the next 5 years.

\- On a smaller scale, Alaskan Energy and DTE Energy both selected the Jouley electric bus to study and obtain their own data on V2G.

\- Blue Bird will provide Nuvve with electric school bus equipped with 155 kWh battery ([source](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/09/20/nuvve-and-blue-bird-combine-to-create-electric-school-buses-that-are-v2g-enabled/))

\- BYD just released a small electric school bus with 150 kWh battery with V2G tech but no partners yet([source](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a38952770/byd-electric-school-bus-v2g-charging/)). BYD might have a difficult time getting partners as BYD is being blacklisted by US government from using tax money.

Most updated list of Utility V2G pilot programs (3/14/22): [link](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/3-design-considerations-electric-school-bus-vehicle-grid-programs)

&#x200B;

**Minimal battery degradation from V2G over 10 years:**

""In the case of frequency regulation and peak load shaving V2G grid services offered 2 hours each day, battery wear remains minimal even if this grid service is offered every day over the vehicle lifetime.""

""Frequency regulation and peak load shaving at power rates typical for vehicle charging and discharging will not significantly accelerate battery degradation in comparison to the degradation incurred from driving and calendar aging. Even in the ”extreme” cases in which we assume all EVs provide grid services from 7:00pm-9:00pm every day for ten years, the capacity losses from frequency regulation and peak load shaving only increase by 3.62% and 5.6%, respectively.""

Source: [Quantifying electric vehicle battery degradation from driving vs. vehicle-to-grid services](http://manuscript.elsevier.com/S0378775316313052/pdf/S0378775316313052.pdf)

&#x200B;

**FYI for potential investors:**

\- Proterra (PTRA) produces battery and drivetrain for Thomas Built Buses as well as other heavy-duty commercial companies. Proterra will have its 3rd and massive 327,000 square foot EV battery factory up and running in the 2nd half of 2022. Proterra also builds electric transit buses.

\- Thomas Built Buses is the oldest American bus manufacturer and is owned by Daimler. Daimler Truck is an investor in Proterra.

\- Lion Electric (LEV) is a Canadian company and it builds electric school buses among other large commercial vehicles.  Lion Electric will have its new $70 million US manufacturing plant completed late 2022.

\- Nuvve (NVVE) specializes in V2G platform and is more of an EV charging company.

The size of the pie(480,000) is so large that no single company can eat it all. Even if everyone gets just 1% of that pie or 4,800 school buses, at [$500/kWh](https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/sustainability/sustainability-12-03977/article_deploy/sustainability-12-03977.pdf) average price for battery and a 226 kWH battery, a company like Proterra would be looking at revenue of $542M for the battery alone. Proterra already [locked up](https://www.proterra.com/press-release/proterra-lg-partner-on-ev-battery-cells/) a stable supply of high-grade Nickel battery cells with LG Energy Solution through 2028.

&#x200B;

To conclude, I believe the fact that our electricity infrastructure being far from perfect is what makes V2G profitable. I'm excited at the potential of V2G opening the door to a massive and untapped market of electrification of 480,000 school buses.",tklbaw,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tklbaw/v2g_tech_bridging_the_gap_between_ev_and_diesel/

2736,Good way to hedge against the SP500?,," Buying 20 year treasuries (TLT) and selling the same amount of high yield bonds (JNK) seems to be a good hedge for a drop in the SP500.

The way I see it is:

\- If JNK moves up more than TLT most likely it means SPY has been going up as well, hopefully SPY has a bigger gain than JNK/TLT ratio.

\-If SPY starts tanking then JNK will lose more (or gain less) than TLT, hopefully offsetting the loses of the SPY.

I wish I could add a chart on this post to show a comparison but anyone in tradingview can search for ""TLT/JNK"" and compare it to SPY.... every time SPY drops TLT/JNK ratio moves up.

I know we are living through historical times with the money printing but what case scenarios could affect the TLT/JNK ratio to not move up when SPY drops?

Any other ways to hedge SP500 drops?

I am a fan of put spreads on SPY or even covered calls on VIX related etfs when SPY is in pain but the issue is the upside is limited and holding just Puts or even VIX related etfs seem to be a bit costly on the long run. With TLT/JNK ratio I feel that even if SPY doubles, the TLT/JNK ratio wouldn't go down as much lol",tk5fi4,1,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tk5fi4/good_way_to_hedge_against_the_sp500/

2743,COIN - Shortseller Jim Chanos Targets Coinbase,,"He announced a new short position in **Coinbase Global Inc** Friday after the market closed on CNBC's ""Closing Bell: Overtime.""  ""Coinbase is what we would call one of the bubble stocks,"" Chanos said. 

&#x200B;

Chanos believes Coinbase's valuation is stretched as a consequence of being one of the only publicly-listed crypto exchanges. Last fall, when the stock was trading between $200 and $300 per share, the adjusted earnings estimate for 2022 was $7, Chanos said. The estimate has since fallen to $3, he said, adding that the stock is actually trading at a higher valuation on a price-to-earnings basis than it was when the share price was much higher. 

&#x200B;

""We think as competition increases amongst the exchanges, you're going to see fee compression and as it is Coinbase will probably not be profitable this year,"" Chanos said before highlighting the company's $40 billion market cap.

&#x200B;

If **Bitcoin** starts surging again and Coinbase trades in sympathy with the oldest cryptocurrency, Chanos warned that his short thesis could be at risk. ""But what we're seeing is the economics are starting to diverge,"" he said, suggesting that Coinbase's stock is unlikely to track Bitcoin moving forward.

2745,Canadian Oil Sands: Buried Treasures,Industry Discussion,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadian-oil-sands-buried-treasures-11647601381?mod=hp_minor_pos19

Dirty, expensive to extract and trapped by a lack of pipelines, Canadian oil sands can be a tough investment proposition. Yet a year of elevated oil prices has turned companies mining them into cash machines.

Soaring energy prices are set to reward almost everyone producing hydrocarbons: Major oil companies and U.S. shale producers reported record free cash flows in 2021 and should do even better this year. Analysts polled by FactSet predict that a subindex of U.S. oil and gas exploration companies in the S&P 500 will beat last year’s bounty by an impressive 35%. Impressive, that is, until compared with Canadian oil sands producers: Suncor Energy, SU -0.16% Canadian Natural Resources, CNQ -0.93% Imperial Oil and Cenovus are set to increase their free cash flow by 60.5% this year, on average.

Longer term, the bull case for carbon-heavy Canadian oil is shakier and will depend in part on a shift to a more nuanced view of environmental, social and governance concerns. Oil sands’ carbon footprint is high, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought social concerns to the forefront—Western oil majors almost immediately pulled out of Russia—as well as the perils of relying on autocratic regimes for vital commodities.

Energy investors today are laser-focused on two things these days: Immediate cash returns and ESG alignment. At the moment, Canadian oil companies are ticking the first box. A paradigm shift in ESG could really supercharge their shares.",thotaf,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/thotaf/canadian_oil_sands_buried_treasures/

I am interested in the opinion of value traders here. The company is unprofitable. 

Simply Wall St did a valuation analysis on the stock and found it to be 35% undervalued! Well, what did they do wrong? They used cash flow without subtracting stock based compensation which is huge!

In the last 12 months, net income =-500 million 

Stock based compensation... = 500 million. Stock based compensation imply future diultion of shareholders.  

It is hard to value an unprofitable company but here is what I did: 

I took their operating income (assumed they are making 100 million instead of  losing money 500) and grew it at 30% for 5 years, and 20% for the following 5 years, and gave it a P/E of 20 in 2032. 

I only discounted at 3% interest rate ... and I get: $**25 Billion ...**

2755,Quick question about WBK - stock that was delisted,Think for me,"Has anyone else been stuck with shares of WBK, which was apparently delisted because it terminated its ADR program and is a foreign stock, which Robinhood will not allow anymore trading on.

I don't have a huge position in this stock, but I'd like to dump it so I can invest the money elsewhere. The email said I had two options: 1) Wait until cash liquidation after June 2, which requires me to do nothing and the shares will be sold automatically ""at some point after June 2nd"" and the cash distributed to me or, 2) Transfer the WBK shares to an outside broker, then convert to foreign shares. This option claims that Robinhood will cover the cost of an ACAT transfer to a broker who supports foreign shares, but when asking about this in a follow up email, Robinhood said there was a $75 transfer fee, which is pretty steep for the paltry position I have with this stock.

I'm pretty new to all of this, so I'm trying to figure out what's best to do here. Curious what anyone else did who was stuck with WBK shares. Below is the verbiage of the email:

\---

The Robinhood team wants to let you know about an upcoming corporate action that may affect your account. On June 2nd, 2022, Westpac Banking Corp (WBK) will terminate its ADR program. An ADR (American Depository Receipt) is a foreign stock purchased by an American bank on a foreign exchange to make it available in the United States. In the case of WBK, each ADR represents one foreign share, which is traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. As of January 31st, Westpac ADRs are no longer trading.

Since Robinhood cannot support the underlying Australian shares, Robinhood customers currently have two options:

1) **Wait until cash liquidation after June 2nd.** If you decide to do nothing, the underlying foreign shares will be sold *automatically* by the issuer at some point after June 2nd, and the cash will be distributed to you. You’ll receive the net of proceeds minus any fees and tax withholding charged by the issuer. (These fees are not charged by Robinhood.)

2) **Transfer your WBK shares to an outside broker, and then convert them into foreign shares.** Since Robinhood can’t support the underlying Australian shares, we’ll cover the cost of an ACAT transfer to a broker that supports foreign shares. Please note that you will be responsible for any fees that the outside broker may charge.

Recently I had a conversation with a friend about this. He was saying for example: 

\- If you have 100 shares of AAPL and bought it at $100 (holding long term)

\- Then I can take some profits, by selling off like 20 shares at some price like $170

\- Now that I have more money, I can re-buy AAPL at a lower entry point and accumulate more shares.

&#x200B;

I am having a hard time accepting his idea.

So would it make sense for me to sell SOME of my shares that I've held long term, and then re-buy more shares at a dip or at a lower entry point?

Yes, REIT’s have risk of being illiquid and losing value depending on if it’s publicly traded or not. However bonds also have risk with interest rate swings and are likely even more illiquid. 

Also bonds return 2-3% while REIT’s return 5-6%. And yes there are REIT’s with considerably high fees but you must do your research first. Also you can diversify with REIT’s just like stocks or bonds.

2780,4-7-22 SPY/ Apple Daily TA,,"Going into today we had a small gap of about 90 cents to fill left on the daily chart. While GAPs almost always fill an upside gap when we are in what appears to be a short term bear trend can be up for debate as there is no real timeframe for gaps to fill. It does appear SPY fills them two days later usually. 

With that being said we saw the bears take hold again today running the VIX back up to 23.82 intraday and a low of 443.53 before saw a massive (what used to be rare but is now common) mid day reversal of trend. While these trends are getting pretty darn old they are becoming fairly common. Again the hint was the back to back massive red candles at 1pm. From there she just kept falling. That 24 level seems to be key “resistance” right now.  

 

As you can see we are within a clear downward what I call a double channel. We are currently trading within and bouncing upward resistance of the upper channel. 

Despite the big energy the bulls came with end of day we saw SPY stop dead in its tracks at 450.5 range and failed to break through that resistance for over an hour before it finally sold off right into candle with a nice fat red candle down to 448.77. 

With the gap being filled and the upper limit holding strong I will be watching for a sell off into after hours and for futures to take a small dip over night. I suspect we could trade around the 446.5 to 44 range after hours. 

&#x200B;

Upper resistance for the channel (assuming we stay with in it overnight) puts resistance at 449.5 for open and support at 445.7  442  438.

 

While I am watching for a bearish formation (see the black channel down) I am monitoring for SPY to find support and continue on a bull run (red channel) of course while also monitoring for a bigger overall channel that I have not been able to establish yet. 

If the BEAR channel holds true tomorrows range is 442.3 to 455.5.

If the BULL channel holds true 445.5 to 460 is tomorrows range. 

The one thing while this chart is very busy I want to point out is the EMAs. Today we saw SPY dip below the 20, 50, and 100 daily EMAs for the 2nd time this week but failed to close below it again. On the upside we rejected quite firmly at the daily 8ema of 450.8. To me the breaking of the 20, 50 and 100 ema AGAIN along with the very firm rejection and red candle into close tonight is bearish for tomorrow and definitely for next week. We also finally have a true downward direction on the daily 8ema. 

Now of course if tomorrow bulls can get this up and over the daily 8ema and close above it I would think 460 comes before 440. However, I will be looking for bears to get back on track again tomorrow and close below the daily 50 ema at 445.3. However, a close below the 100ema at 446.75 or the daily 20 ema at 447.21 would also be a bearish indication for next week. 

We also have a confirmed daily MACD sell and RSI still a 53 trending sideways now. 

 

Same thing with the weekly chart here the bears were able to get it down below the weekly 20 and 8ema which is very bearish and I will look for them to close this candle tomorrow below the 20 and 8ema at 445.38/ 446.64. A close there with a firmly red candle below the doji last week would solidify some red downside next week in my opinion. 

 

The VIX has another MASSIVE day today with a total range from peaks to lows of 21.12 to 23.82 or a move of 12% again today. Some very big moves this week with the VIX that’s for sure.  

Before someone says “YoU cAnT tA tHe ViX” Yes I know this… duh… BUT you can watch key levels and right now this month the low has been 18.7 and the high 24.8. What the means to me is closing at 21.56 we are pretty much right in the middle of the current month range. Bulls and Bears both have a chance to capitalize tomorrow.

  

Apple had a pretty unexciting day today finishing at a small 0.18% green. We saw it break its key support at the daily 20ema again of 171. However, it too saw an end of day bull run that hard rejected its daily 8ema at 173.72 to close at 172.14. With an already red after market i will look for that to continue over night. SPY bears will like to see Apple close its week out with a candle below the daily 20ema at 171 tomorrow with hopes of seeing 165-168 next week. However, the bulls need a close above the 8ema tomorrow. 

Range for tomorrow based off the current black bull channel puts us at 171.3 to 178 (unlimited upside tomorrow). The yellow bear channel (much like SPY) gives a range of 171.3 to 160 (unlimited downside tomorrow).

 

Apples Weekly chart has a similar break target of below the 8ema of 169.1 tomorrow to ensure a red week next week. 

10% challenge-

I had a pretty incredible day today. I had realized gains of 6x my daily profit goal today alone. Heading into tomorrow this is shaping up to be a killer week. I played a 1dte call for -10%, a 1dte put 10%, 4dte put 23%, 6dte put 20%, 1dte put 20% and a 4dte call for 15% today.

2790,How to claim dividends?,Resources,"**Introduction** 

This article explains the Investor Education and Protection Fund as well as the requirements that must be met when transferring unclaimed or unpaid dividends to the Investor Education and Protection Fund. Let’s explore the topic of Compliances related to the transfer of unpaid and unclaimed dividends to the Investor Education and Protection Fund under the Companies Act, 2013

**How to claim dividends?**

According to Section 124 of the Companies Act of 2013, if a dividend is not compensated or asserted in less than 30 days of the proclamation, the corporation should move the actual sum of unpaid/unclaimed dividend to a special account in any banking institution after the expiry date of 7 days of the said period of 30 days, and the account will be referred to as an ""Unpaid dividend account."" When an amount has remained unclaimed or unpaid in an unpaid dividend account for a period of seven years, the unpaid or unclaimed amount will be transferred to the Investor Education Protection Fund within the next 30 days (IEPF).

**What is an Investor Education Protection Fund, and how does it work?**

According to Section 125 of the Companies Act, 2015, the Central Government (Ministry of Corporate Affairs), with the help of SEBI, has established the Investor Education Protection Fund to protect investors' interests and increase the number of investors by encouraging and educating them on the practical aspects and legal responsibilities of the securities market, as well as the option of refunding unclaimed dividends that are transferred.

**How do I get my IEPF unpaid dividend?**

By completing the IEPF-5 form, any unclaimed and unpaid shareholder whose funds have been transferred by the company to the Investor Education and Protection Fund can claim the unpaid amount from the IEPF Authority.

**What is** [IEPF form-5](https://muds.co.in/recovery-shares-iepf/)**, and how does it work?**

By submitting Form IEPF-5 online, an eligible person may apply for a refund of their unclaimed dividend, matured debentures and deposits, and respective physical share certificate under Section 125 and Subsection 3 of the Companies Act, as well as Rule 7(1) of the IEPF Authority (Accounting, Audit, Refund, and Transfer), Rules 2016.

2. The number of shares/amount to be claimed
3. In the case of non-resident Indians and foreigners: Number of a passport or an Overseas Indian Citizen/Person of Indian Origin card.

# Conclusion

The article answered the most searched question **“**[how to claim dividend](https://muds.co.in/recovery-of-shares/)**”** in depth. Unclaimed dividends in the investor education and protection fund have been estimated to Be rs. 4,100 crores, according to an approximate authored on March 31, 2020. Though the government has relaxed and simplified the process for shareholders to claim their dividends from the IEPF, certain aspects, such as the complexity involved if the physical share certificate and are no longer linked to a bank account, the death of an investor, as a result of which his bank account has been closed, or even a simple address change, have caused serious difficulties for shareholders in claiming their dividends. It's also worth noting that in 2019 and 2020, the government approved over 6000 investor claims for unpaid dividends and matured company deposits through the investor education and production finance.",tws4t6,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tws4t6/how_to_claim_dividends/

After extraordinary military buildup around Ukraine borders, I was kind of sure Russia will invade it unlike doubters, so I invested accordingly (oil and grain, basically commodities that Russia and Ukraine produce most), then when invasion started I cashed in and started to collect Euro shares that lost quite a bit value. Now I am cashing them in gradually since peace talks in Turkey they are gaining quite a bit value.

So now I ended up with with some cash in my hand and I don't want to keep it as Euro, because ECB looks like very slow reacting to inflation, so every cash you hold will lose value surely and believe me I know Europe, they will think 10 times before moving a finger against CPI then they will be late as usual. I don't want to re-invest in stocks, they are likely perform similar to inflation at this point and I don't have too much trust in myself about finding an outperforming individual stock, so what to do, is there really a good alternative, may be I should buy some real estates (joking)?

That's  why I   stared searching for a broker which offer the same services as  eToro.   Then I came to XTB - Polish broker, which operates in EU. I  played a   bit with their system, and it looks good to me.

Luckily    they seems to be very transparent, which is good, but I still cannot    understand few things in there. For instance, they have tax called:    adjustment fee and swap fee, but this doesn't make sense to me. Even I    went to their website I cannot understand why this is needed.  
Because I haven't seen this anywhere else, I'm wondering if this is acceptable/normal or not.

But even the pessimists today‌ expect inflation to trend down through the second half of 2022 and into 2023.**The Fed is on it** The Federal Reserve hiked the Fed funds rate target on March 16 by 0.25% and plan to keep hiking until inflation is under control.

Although this is above the 13% historical odds of recession, the risk is still relatively low. This is due to a well-balanced economy, high savings levels, low unemployment and relatively easy credit conditions.**Stay the course** ISG encourages clients to make sure they have the right strategic asset allocation to be able to withstand the volatility in the current environment, and maintains its recommendation to stay invested.

I am looking for some good youtube channels that would explain some of the lingo and strategy around personal investing.

I was told it has something to do with an old call option that I sold for a loss the other day, being added into this new option? Also it was marked a wash sale due to selling for a loss and buying back. I thought that only applies to stocks, not options as well. Live and learn I guess. 

Could anybody explain the whole but about why my cost basis is so high and not representing what I paid for it today, but instead representing what I paid for it today AND the sale of my last one?

2815,"With a 800$/month investment for 3 years, what can I do ?",Advice Request,"Hello !

As title says, unless my parents house burn down I can invest around 800$ every month (social welfare). It's actually 1000$, but I have to deduct charges (food, gas and bike insurance) out of it.

I have absolutely no idea what to do, barely know anything about banking as well. What's a safe placement to do ? I saw people talking about VTI/SPY being a safe profit in the long-run, google only says its value kept rising (overall) every year.

If so, what am I supposed to do ? Find a bank in my country that allows to buy stocks, and split the 800$ on these two things ? Or do something completely different, even unrelated to the subreddit ?

Thanks in advance!

2818,Hackers of Axie Infinity steal $625 million,News,"You've probably seen the news - it happened last Wednesday and Axie/Ronin creators Sky Mavis confirmed it on Tuesday. Hackers stole $625 million worth of Ethereum and stablecoin USDT from Axie Infinity, a popular NFT video game with 8 million players worldwide. In the game, players earn non-fungible tokens that are then traded for cryptocurrencies. Hackers infiltrated the Ronin network, the ""bridge"" that essentially allows players to transfer crypto in and out of the game.

**Cyberattacks are the trend**

**Cryptocurrency** networks have continuously reassured users of their security, but hacks are becoming commonplace. $600 million was stolen from the Poly Network last August and earlier in January, hackers withdrew over $30 million from Crypto, though most of the funds were returned.

**Businesses and institutions** are not safe either. Ransomware victims have included everyone from Colonial Pipeline to the 44 public school systems nationwide that were attacked last year. The health care industry faced a 755% increase in those attacks in 2021 as well.

**Governments** internationally saw a 1,885% increase in ransomware attacks, according to a 2022 cybersecurity report by SonicWall. Most notably, the White House has warned that infrastructure in the U.S. could be targeted because of the Russian-Ukraine conflict, urging private companies to bolster their cyber defenses.

**Investment in peace of mind**

Cybersecurity companies like Fortinet, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne have gathered momentum. With the rise of cyberattacks on all fronts and increasing popularity of decentralized services, cybersecurity is persistent global concern and projected to grow into a $370 billion market by 2028.

**TL;DR:** Hide your kids, hide your wife, cuz they're hacking everybody out here and look into cybersecurity.

I own LHCG, been averaging down and will see a nice premium, but I am considering a position in AMED, which I see as pretty much a direct competitor with little difference.  I also own ADUS, which is in the same space but a little different. I own LHCG and not AMED due to internal issues with workforce at AMED that seem like temporary headwinds.

2826,Quick useful tip on an easy way to find a companies intrinsic value (from managements POV),Advice,"I especially do this with every company that has had an IPO within past 3-5 years as you can usually find something hidden on it.

Here's an example from TOST 10K report. [Page 121](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016422000009/tost-20211231.htm) says this:

>In consideration for the acquisition of xtraCHEF, we issued 569,400 shares of common stock to the seller shareholders with a fair value of $26.10 per share on the acquisition date supported by a contemporaneous valuation.

They acquired xtraCHEF on June 8th 2021.

TOST IPO price was $55 on Sep. 24th 2021.

That's an increase in share price of around 115%\~ in just 3 months. How can a companies intrinsic value increase by more than double in 3 months? Well... it simple cannot. This means either management (or the third party appraiser, not sure who valued it exactly) valued their stock too low on the aquistion of xtraChef OR it means the IPO price of $55 is grossly overvalued... Now I'll let you decide which one is the obvious answer here :)

TOST has a fair value (according to their own management or a third party appraisal) of around $26.10 today.

TOST value today is $19. Insiders have been recently buying. A combination of these signs mean that the stock (even without my own DCF) is probably undervalued at today's price.

Always always try and look for what management thinks their own fair value of stock in the annual reports.

Usually you can find some type of acquisition like this or similar. I found the same thing in RobinHood where management believe the fair value of $HOOD is around $16.

Simple things like this can guide you towards the true value and stop you from overpaying.

2828,Is my Broker legit?,Advice,"Hi guys. 25m here, with very little experience in buying/trading stocks and wanted to get some advice from y'all.

I live in the EU. One day at work I received a call from a UK survey asking general questions about my job position and what I invest in (which has only been crypto up until now). I indulged the nice lady and that was that... Or so I thought...

A month later I got a call from a broker called Ability corporate advisory. Who are based out of Hong Kong and I believe have some sort of set up in Singapore. They got my details from the survey people of course, and so began the back and forth between me and this guy.

The proposal is a 5000euro purchase amount of stock what he called institutional prices? (as in less than what the banks would give them to you for, if I am using the term right), and they take 1% in and out of the transaction with an estimated 90day turn around with projected profits of 47%.

I guess what I am really wondering is whether this broker is legit, as in whether anybody has heard of them? They have a well laid out website and a company registration in Hong Kong, but there is pretty much nothing else about them online.

If you haven't heard of them is there any easy way to tell if I am being scammed? Or even what they would have to provide me with on stock purchase?

Sorry I my message seems like it jumps around a bit. Its late here atm and I needed to get this off my mind.

2838,Is Overnight Funding going to take the majority of my profit.,Newbie,"Stock newbie here. I have held some stock in a few companies since the COVID crash. I noticed today that I made roughly £100 on an open position, but if I were to ""cash out"" I would only make £30 because the overnight funding is costing me £70. I checked all my other positions too which were opened at similar dates. My larger shares have similar fees (£70~).

Anyway. My question is, the point of my investment was to earn some quite nice money when/if the stock market recovers from COVID, let's say that takes 3 more years, is my (theoretical number) 1K profit going to end up being a couple of hundred, or potentially even negative??

I am sorry if this is a dumb question but I only just discovered this and cannot find an answer. I have found the formula but still don't understand it. Does it also accumulate daily or reset?

2841,New Investment Strategy - Brainstorm Party,,"Hey everyone, was hoping to see if I could get some opinions on a potential new (at least new for me) strategy. I’ve been very modestly investing in individual companies with the super majority of my funds going straight into either the SP500 (FXAIX – Fidelity’s index fund) and Nasdaq (QQQ).

I’ve been reading how diversification can help lower overall risk but can also impact portfolio growth. My goal is NOT to buy $2000 Tesla calls or $250 Amazon leaps for a potential post-stock-split-surge or anything like that (and quite honestly, I barely have touched contracts so just bear with me if that verbiage is off lol). It also seems like doing the “*classic*” “100 minus your age” formula for stock to bonds ratio seems extreme, as I’m 29 years old having my portfolio and 29% bonds seems ridiculous – ***to me*** (debating this is not so much my hope for in this post lol). I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to get over the fact that the [Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX)](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/VBTLX:MUTF?window=MAX) has had a 2.54% increase since November 16, 2001 granting about a 0.12% increase per year, on average, over the last 21 years – not inflation adjusted.

# Goal

To find some type of happy medium between spending all day researching stocks (which I enjoy – but not sure how sustainable that is long term as I do data analysis full time and someday, in the next 3-5 years, will hopefully have kiddos to look after) and over-diversification which *could* prevent portfolio growth (....*and is a little boring*).

# Disclaimers before continuing:

**1.**  I know that adding bonds to your portfolio hedges against risk but as I’m still (very slightly) part Ape..I just really don’t care about taking a big hit – AS LONG AS I KNOW I’m invested in good companies that will (also understand this isn't guaranteed) bounce back over the next 30 years.  
**2.** I know that SP500 is roughly 500 companies and that QQQ is even less at about 100. Which you could easily argue is pretty concentrated. My argument against this is that there are a handful of companies that I personally don’t like as much (some from moral standpoints, some just purely uninterested and would rather have my money invested elsewhere) and that with the top 10 companies (really the top 9 since Google is always split into Class A and Class C for some reason in these holdings) they generally make up 30% of the entire allocation (at least in the SP500). So if I’m okay with a *little* more risk (hoping for a little more growth) why not purely invest in those?

# Alright – to the potential strategy part..

My thought is that I could pull the holdings of SP500 ([FXAIX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/315911750) for this example – [here is the full list of holdings](https://www.actionsxchangerepository.fidelity.com/ShowDocument/ComplianceEnvelope.htm?_fax=-18%2342%23-61%23-110%23114%2378%23117%2320%23-1%2396%2339%23-62%23-21%2386%23-100%2337%2316%2335%23-68%2391%23-66%2354%23103%23-16%2369%23-30%2358%23-20%2376%23-84%23-11%23-87%230%23-50%23-20%23-92%23-98%23-116%23-28%2358%23-38%23-43%23-39%23-42%23-96%23-88%2388%23-45%23-32%23-112%23-4%23-65%23-3%2375%23102%23-104%23-74%235%23-89%23-105%23-67%23126%2377%23-126%23100%2345%23-44%23-73%23-15%238%23-21%23-37%23-17%23-14%23-98%23123%23-18%2345%23-59%23-82%2367%2383%23112%2317%2370%23-78%2378%23-50%2336%23-86%23-90%2381%23-21%23-119%23-30%23120%2349%2328%23-98%2333%2351%23-78%23-119%23-16%2350%23-58%2350%23102%2348%23-17%2352%23-99%23), you may need to click “Monthly Holdings Report” tab on that link if you’re not directed there). Then get the top 10 companies (you could change this to top 5, top 20, 30, etc. – whatever you’d feel comfortable with, obviously the more you add, the more diversification, the less risk, and the closer to SP500 performance you’d be).

In this example, we’ll take the top 11 holdings (since Google is split into two – we’ll combine that leaving us with top 10 companies). Grab the allocation percentage for each, add those up, then divide the allocation percent by the sum to get it based on 100%. Calculation walkthrough:

**1.** Apple is currently #1 at 7.098%  
**2.** If you add the top 11 holdings you get 30.028%  
**3.** 7.098/30.028 = 23.638%. This would be the allocation in our portfolio for Apple

**Test Portfolio Allocation**:

|Company|Our Test Portfolio Allocation|SP500(FXAIX) Allocation 3/2022|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Apple (AAPL)|23.64%|7.10%|
|Microsoft (MSFT)|20.26%|6.08%|
|Google (GOOG + GOOGL)|13.65%|4.10%|
|Amazon (AMZN)|11.32%|3.40%|
|Tesla (TSLA)|6.61%|1.99%|
|Meta Platforms (FB)|6.43%|1.93%|
|NVIDIA (NVDA)|5.31%|1.60%|
|Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK.B)|4.98%|1.49%|
|Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)|3.94%|1.18%|
|UnitedHealth Group (UNH)|3.86%|1.16%|
|**Total**|100.0%|30.03%|

# Backtesting

Before I’d want to implement this strategy, I’d want to try to back test it and compare it to SP500 performance. This is just difficult because the *holdings change over time*. I can’t take the holdings of the SP500 today and compare it over the last 20 or 30 years because they were not allocated similarly back in 2000 or 1990. Similarly, it’s surprisingly difficult trying to find something along the lines of historical, monthly holdings (or even historical, annual holdings) for these index funds/ETFs.

In an attempt to use the current holdings, I created a portfolio test comparing the new strategy to FXAIX from *1/1/2021 to today* and it looks like we have pretty good results. I know this is an extremely short time range but at least it’s something.

Here's a [screenshot to the portfolio test](https://imgur.com/a/Y1K00z8). The highlighted portion is for argument #1 below.

# The two main arguments I could see going against this strategy is:

**1.** If the top 10 companies underperform the rest of the SP500 then, because you’re not as diversified you could have a larger loss. And yes, while I’d agree with that, I'd also add if the top 10 are going down, the whole thing is more than likely going down – while FXAIX may drop less than our test portfolio (like we see highlighted in 9/2021 to 10/2021 in the [portfolio test screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/Y1K00z8)), having a more concentrated portfolio in these top companies, I believe, long term, may give better results while also giving you a steady strategy to keep your eyes on for the future.  
**2.** You can have companies go bankrupt (like General Electric, Sears, etc.), how do you account for this? Those companies don’t just fall off the face of the earth, we saw a decline in their holdings percentage as they lost market cap - to be honest, I don't know exactly how quickly they fell from their places in the top 10 since finding that historical information is a little bit of a pain and this was before I really followed the markets. However, this loss in market cap would be reflected in our portfolio as well. Because of taxes, I don’t know if you’d want to rebalance monthly or what the best cadence would be – but I think rebalancing either quarterly or semi-annually would be okay. Also note, if Apple (or any one of those top 10 companies) were to...say double their debt while losing like 50% of cash flow or something, I’d bet just about anything we’d see headlines all over the place – so yes, it may be beneficial to keep some type of finger on the pulse of the market but it’d be much more hands-off than reading 10-Ks/doing fundamental research and technical analysis.

&#x200B;

This strategy seems like it lets you invest in the greatest companies in the world and be more concentrated in those companies, while also taking the emotional aspect out of the game. Wanted to know everyone’s thoughts on this and see if we can poke any holes! Thanks all!",tmp710,1,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tmp710/new_investment_strategy_brainstorm_party/
2842,Upcoming Merger between Discovery & Warner bros DD,Fundamentals/DD,"I want to pitch you guys with an investment opportunity. But please remember to do your own due diligence. Let me know if I've gotten anything wrong. I want to avoid providing a biased pitch, so I'd shy from giving my assumptions.

Ok, here we go.

* Discovery is merging with Warner bros, which is set to close Q2 2022. We don't know the date, but has already obtained all anti-trust and regulatory authority approvals.
* Discovery Warner bro joint company is set to generate $52bn revenue on pro forma basis, which puts it the number #1 streaming platform compared to $NFLX & $DIS.
* Discovery is a profitable yet boring company. Sure, many of you have come across very profitable companies with declining future profitability prospects therefore depressed valuations e.g., Altria, KHC, KO, etc.
* Discovery generates approximately $2bn in free cash flow at $14bn valuation. Growing revenue and cost at GDP and work backward on a DCF model, market implied perpetual growth rate is only -1%. Yes, the market is pricing the company in steady decline for -1% every year despite the company generated 14% top line improvement last year.
* Discovery and Warner bros merger will create the deepest library content for streaming platform in the market. Management already said the joint company will join their streaming application into one, meaning combining IPs such as Suicide Squad, Peace maker, Food channel, etc.
* Discovery is also one of the very few streaming platform offering sports entertainment including NHL, NCAA, Olympics, etc.
* Qualitative aside. Let's talk valuations. The company is currently trading 1x 2023 forward EV/Sales compared to 2.5x $DIS and 4.5x $NFLX.
* A slight multiple re-rate to 2x on pro forma basis already brings your investment 2x at today's valuation. I know I said no assumptions for me, but if I have to give my target, I have a rule of thumb for top contender trading 75% of market leader multiple, so that's roughly 3.3x. Or if worst case scenario, if it just trades close but lower to $DIS, you still get over 100% return on the investment. This is one of the least followed company on Fitwit and I believe there are some mispricing remains.
* Two reasons why the mis-pricing exist today. 1) there's still no set date on merger schedule despite approvals have been obtained from regulatory body and the board. 2) Discovery has yet to provide on post merger share translation information. There's a very informative article on Seeking alpha by Livy research that gives an estimate on a likely scenario on shares translation on the joint company. I will refrain from providing link because there's a rule against seeking alpha on reddit (I think?).

Let me know if I'm missing anything guys. I've been following event driven opportunities for sometime, and this is one of the wildest underprice pre merger opportunity just yet.

Thank you all for reading. Let me know your thoughts in the comments, and happy trading. Thanks.",tmm9v5,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tmm9v5/upcoming_merger_between_discovery_warner_bros_dd/

BMO raises cash it needs for Bank of the West acquisition



 BMO raised the cash it needs to pay for its proposed $20.5-billion acquisition of Bank of the West on Tuesday by selling $2.7-billion of stock.

BMO staged one of the largest bought deals ever done in Canadian markets, issuing 18.125 million shares at $149 each to a syndicate of investment banks late Tuesday. In this type of financing, investment banks purchase shares from a company such as BMO at a set price and take the risk that they can then sell the stock to investors.

The equity offering came after BMO’s share price rose by 17 per cent since late December, when the bank announced a friendly takeover of San Francisco-based Bank of the West and its 500-branch network.

Bank of the West is currently owned by French giant BNP Paribas, which is selling the division to focus on expansion in Europe. The takeover is expected to close by the end of the year.

BMO is funding the bulk of the planned acquisition – the largest takeover of a U.S. bank by a Canadian buyer – with excess capital on its own balance sheet and Bank of the West’s. When it announced the transaction in December, Toronto-based BMO said it would raise $2.7-billion from a stock sale to pay the remainder of the purchase at some point this year

Early this month, analysts asked BMO chief executive officer Darryl White about the timing of the equity offering during a conference call. Mr. White said: “We have had investors express some interest and say to us that they’re there when we’re ready. So we’ll just take it all into consideration, and we’ll pick the time that we think is best for our shareholders.”",tkjl11,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tkjl11/i_need_some_help_with_this/

The SpaceX founder was responding to a CNBC report, noting that U.S. space companies were set to benefit from Russia’s isolation, according to Quilty Analytics. The report said SpaceX would be the “clear winner” in the launch market.

“SpaceX default plan was \~65% of global launch to orbit this year. Incremental demand might take that to \~70%, so not a major change,” said Musk, noting that those numbers don’t include Starship.

2856,Buying put options instead of holding bonds for long term investor,,"So, I've been following the old school way of holding bonds as a hedge against downwards trends in equities, which, as you can imagine, hasn't been so hot lately. I'm about 70% equities (SPLV), 30% long term bonds (TLT). So a fairly conservative portfolio. The equities part of my portfolio isn't so bad right now, but bonds are getting trashed. 

With that trashing in mind, I'm thinking I could buy long term puts (1 year) on the underlying equities I hold, instead. Every six months, I would be selling them, and buy new 1 year puts, which seem to be the timing that has the lowest carrying costs. 

It seems to me it would be cheaper to do that in a rising market than traditional bond holding, which reduce the amount invested in equities by the value held in bonds, and hence, the return. I could also invest in more aggressive ETFs than SPLV, since the downwards trend would be protected.

Being the inverse of the long equities position, it means it would also do well during a major correction. 

The only issue would be during a flat market, but then, I see that as the cost of getting ""insurance"".

2858,Warby Parker (WRBY) Post Earnings Stock Analysis,Opinion,"  Warby Parker is an online and brick-and-mortar retailer for men’s and women’s glasses and contact lenses. They offer direct to consumer sales and donate a pair of glasses for every pair of glasses bought. Warby Parker was founded in 2009 and is based in New York City, and went public via direct listing on September 29, 2021.


  Warby Parker, $WRBY, recently reported their Q4 2021 earnings, coming in at -$0.08 EPS and $132.9M in Net Revenue. This EPS was a beat by $0.01, but the Revenue was a slight miss. When it comes to guidance for 2022 they expect 20-22% growth, slightly lower than analyst expectations due to the effects of omicron. Warby Parker also expects to open 40 new stores this year, bringing their total to 201. It is also important to note that their cost of goods increased at the same rate as their net revenue, which means they weren’t spending more to produce goods than they were bringing in. This is a sign of a healthy growing company.


  While $WRBY price was initially hit up to 15% off these earnings, it closed the day green, and has continued to run up since earnings, as part of an overall market move. 


  As for my thoughts, I think Warby Parker will come in line for the 2022 growth target of 20%-22%. Their cash and cash equivalents remain strong, and with growing revenue, I expect a strong fiscal 2022. Because of these strong financials, I would give $WRBY a BUY rating, with anything under $34 considered a “Strong Value”, and a price range target of $47.37 to $52.35. 


This is #notfinancialadvice, just my personal opinion, so it is subject to change, or it could be wrong. At the time of writing this, I am LONG $WRBY.",ti8y7r,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ti8y7r/warby_parker_wrby_post_earnings_stock_analysis/

Thank you to any that take the time to respond.

2861,Are we headed for a more serious crash?,,"The economy right now feels a lot like it did in the 1970s. Back then we were coming off of a long stretch of post-war prosperity and a huge run up in stock prices, and years of excess government spending caused very high inflation. That period of time (1968-1982) was brutal in the market, and the DOW dropped about 75% over that time. It took big stones to invest your money in a market like that.

2863,When do you profit on an option order? (Breakeven price),Discussion,"I've been options trading for around 2 weeks now and have been doing relatively fine. (FOMC did me really nice yesterday) Although I have a question that I haven't quite figured out. This morning I had the idea to buy a TSLA 760 call with a breakeven price of around $871. I could have banked on this trade if I wasn't limited to the PDT flag although the swing didn't really worry me as the expiration for this contract is in April.

With that being said, here is my question. If I had bought the Call at $845 (B-E at $871) would I be making money on the entire climb up it made today? and if so then what is this breakeven price really talking about? I have made money on contracts even when they're not at their breakeven price.

2864,Is oil >$100/barrel a problem for the US economy?,Discussion,"I think yes. I called up 20 trucking companies when oil hit $120/barrel and all activity ceased. Basically freight rates were flat to down as retailers have no visibility on demand, while fuel was significantly up.

People have grown far less concerned about oil price over the past few days. I think the are missing 2 major points (1) US is depleting its reserves and dumping oil to manage the price (2) china has been VERY weak and is the largest consumer of oil behind the US and the largest importer

1. Dumping out of SPR is a short term fix. Adding 60mm barrels is meaningful (30mm from US after depleting 50mm in November). As a comparison, Russia produced 3.7mm barrels/day in 2019. So its basically like adding an entire new county worth of supply for \~15-30days. Keep in mind the reserves are not that big. Only \~600mm barrels - I think 15+ year low
2. What happens when the Chinese economy recovers? Not that I am seeing any signs of that, but its been over 2 years now and I would have to think that China will come up with some solution to address COVID at some point.

Here is some supply/demand data from the EIA ...i am concerned. I have no idea how the Fed is so confident on economic growth. Would love to hear thoughts.

I don't like the idea of just leaving 401Ks floating around when moving jobs. Consequently, I moved my old jobs 401K into a Fidelity Traditional Rollover IRA account.

Right now I have another Fidelity 401K from a more recent job that I haven't moved yet, and that one is 100%  allocated to a fund called  ""FFLEX"" for me which I believe is one of those targeted retirement date funds.

I now need to choose what to invest in for the one I just moved into a rollover.

It's about $9.3K and I am 23. No idea what to invest it in, but I read that the ""target date"" retirement funds are generally considered not as lucrative as other investment options.

Can someone give me any advice on how they would spread out the %s keeping in mind it is with Fidelity?

I posted this to r/investments but didn't get any traction and I really have no idea anything about investment funds...hopefully someone can help me out who has some more experience in this than I do.

2867,What are your possible multibagger stocks to play the possible rebound in the next few years?,,"Out of adversity comes opportunity. While most active investors that weren't invested in Commodities or Real Estate are taking a beating, bears are laughing all the way to the bank, index investors and stock pickers are eyeing the stock market for opportunities. I am one of those, and while I somewhat disagree with the idea of index investing, I have something in common with them: the idea that the market, save for a few points in time, will always go up. Now, I'm not advocating for timing the market (well, I mean, kinda), nor am I calling the bottom. I'm suggesting that the current downward trend of the market will end at some point, and will be prime time to buy amazing companies at a discount. Some of the exact same type of companies that are being punished today will be the heroes of tomorrow. So for those of you who haven't relented to index investing and still dream of multibagger gains, what companies are on your radar that you think right now are multibagger opportunities (and will only become more attractive as markets keep going down).",teps3s,0,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/teps3s/what_are_your_possible_multibagger_stocks_to_play/

-Book Value of $17

It’s current market cap of $37M is incredibly disappointing for a company that did nearly $100M in revenue in the LAST QUARTER. I have never seen a PROFITABLE company trade at $37M market cap on $400M annual revenue, which is why I think it’s a great opportunity for this board.

2877,My Due Dilligence on Harley-Davidson (HOG),Fundamentals/DD,"When reading the book ”*You can be a Stock Market Genius*” by Joel Greenblatt, I recently learned that there are numerous special situations in which big profits are awaiting the patient and observant investor. As explained in the biggest chapter of the book, one category of special situations that can reveal an unique investment opportunity are spin-offs. In the analysis below, I will explain why I believe Harley-Davidson (HOG) to be one of these special investment opportunities. Please notice at first that most spin-offs are done to create shareholder value, that is, investors find it difficult to value one share price for a company that consists of multiple companies and therefore investments. Management mostly finds that the shareholders value can be increased by separating the businesses, therefore providing more clarity to the market and more value towards the shareholders (e.g. management due to their incentive schemes). The facts are overwhelming. Stocks of spinoff companies, and even shares of the parent companies that do the spinning off, significantly and consistenly outperform the market averages...

**1. INTRODUCTION**

I refer to the Harley-Davidson website and their [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley-Davidson) for a thorough read on what Harley-Davidson is and what they stand for as a company. For clarity, I assume from now on the reader is accustomed to the business model and general company information of Harley-Davidson. Since the purpose of this blog is investment related, we focus on the investment related information. First, we notice several interesting points that highlight the potential value investing in Harley-Davidson (HOG):

* The stock trades at $36.40 (at the time of writing), with a 52-week range of (32.13 – 52.06). This indicates that HOG trades towards the lower end of their 52-week range and may indicate that HOG is **undervalued** relatively to their own price history.
* The PE-ratio (price to earnings) ratio is currently 8.73. For comparison, the PE-ratio of Tesla is 212.41 while the PE-ratio of the S&P500 is 25.57. This means that relatively towards the broader market, HOG is priced lower which may indicate that HOG is currently **undervalued**.
* With a stock price of $36.40, and given the fact that HOG has 153.569M shares outstanding, this leads towards a marketcap of he market cap $5.52B.
* HOG has a dividend of $0.1575 quarterly, which adds up to $0.63 yearly, or a dividend yield of 1.73%.
* According to Yahoo Finance, we notice that HOG has total cash of $1.08B, which is approximately $7.01 cash per share. This returns you 19.25% (7.01/36.40) of your investment in cash.
* For the 2018-2022 period, HOG has positive FCF’s (Free cash flow), has net debt and has remained profitable which shows the constant performs of the company.
* Harley-Davidson is currently implementing its 2021-2025 strategic plan (The Hardwire). The company is focused on reigniting the spirit of Harley-Davidson and returning to winning, delivering the timeless pursuit of adventure and freedom for the soul for riders around the world.
* The historical return for holding HOG stock has been -10.60% (1Yr) and -39.60% (5Yr) showing a clear downward trend.
* The P/S ratio is 1.13, showing that investors are investing $1.13 for every $1 the company earns in revenue. For comparison the P/S ratio of Apple is 7.88.
* The book value per share is $16.63, which leads to a P/B ratio of 2.18. Value investors often consider stocks with a P/B ratio under 3.0.

Concludingly, the above analysis shows that Harley-Davidson is attractively valued based upon various statistics and valuation techniques. There is, however, one last gem to be discovered in our investment analysis...

**2. THE LIVEWIRE SPIN-OFF**

Harley-Davidson has a electric motorcycle business unit (Livewire) that is planned to go public in a recent  deal. This means that Livewire is the first publicly traded EV motorcycle company in the US. The combined company is expected to have an enterprise value of approximately $1.77 billion and post-money equity value (= marketcap) of approximately $2.31 billion at closing. Investors are able to then buy shares in the newly formed company, while Harley-Davidson still remains in control of **74% of Livewire stock**. Given the fact that even Dr. Michael Burry recently has taken up a position in the stock, we examine this deal a little further. We further notice that according to their own figures, Livewire has an annual 2021 revenue of $33M. Livewire, given their valuation of roughly $2B and their sales of $33M in 2021. When comparing this to various other EV companies, we note that:

* Rivian has a marketcap of $35.866B. Sales 2021 of 55 million.
* Nio has a marketcap of $40.43B. Sales 2021 of 5.68 million.
* Lucid has a marketcap of $38.141B. Sales 2021 of 27 million.
* Tesla has a marketcap of $1.081T. Sales 2021 of $53B.

Livewire has a higher revenue for their valuation, or put differently, Livewire has a lower valuation for their revenue compared to other EV companies. If the valuation of Livewire would be similar to that of other EV companies, the valuation of Livewire would be multiples higher than the $2B stated in the recent accouncement.2) According to the Livewire investor presentation, the company projects $1B revenue between 2025 and 2026. This higher revenue could eventually lead to a higher valuation.3) The $2.3B recent valuation of Livewire, and the 74% stake of HOG in Livewire leads to a potential ownership of (74% x 2.3B  =) $1.7B for Harley-Davidson. For conservative purposes, we round this number to $1.5B. The total number of shares outstanding for Harley-Davidson is 153.569M, which means that the 74% ownership of Livewire constitutes to around $9.7 per share of Harley-Davidson...

&#x200B;

**3. THE INSIDERS**

In ”*You can be a Stock Market Genius*” we find further explanation:\*\*”Insider participation is one of the key areas to look for when picking and choosing between spinoffs. Are the managers of the new spinoff incentivized along the same lines as shareholders? Will they receive a large part of their potential compensation in stock?”\*\*Simply put, when insiders benefits to the same extent as you the shareholder, their incentives are in line with yours (e.g. they too want a higher share price).1) From the Livewire investor presentation, we notice that Jochen Zeitz (CEO of Harley-Davidson) and Gina Goetter (CFO of Harley-Davidson) will become the CEO and CFO of Livewire, respectively. Please notice from the 74% ownership, that a higher share price of Livewire would eventually lead to a higher share price of Harley-Davidson, and therefore the incentives of management are clearly aligned to that of the shareholders of both companies.2) According to their latest SEC filing on April 1st, we notice several executive compensation plans. We highlight several significant developments:

* **Proposal 4**: We are seeking shareholder approval for an amendment (the “Plan Amendment”) to the Harley-Davidson, Inc. 2020 **Incentive Stock Plan** (the “2020 Plan”) to increase the authorized number of shares of our common stock by 3.3 million, bringing the total number of shares authorized under the 2020 Plan since its adoption to 8.7 million.
* **Proposal 5**: We are seeking shareholder approval for an Aspirational Incentive Plan (the “AIP”) authorizing the grant to our President and Chief Executive Officer and a small group of other executive leaders of up to 3.0 million aspirational **performance share**s or performance share units (“Performance Shares”) relating to our common stock, contingent upon achievement of specific stock price thresholds.
* The CEO has given up $600.000 in base salary in order to receive stock options with strike prices between $45 and $65. In addition, the letter agreement provides that Mr. Zeitz will be eligible to participate in our long-term incentive plan and will receive an equity award consisting of RSUs with a target value of $6.0 million as of the grant date of February 9, 2022 and an award of options to purchase 500,000 shares of our common stock, which we have called the WIN stock options. The Board elected to grant the WIN stock options rather than performance share units as the long-term performance component of Mr. Zeitz’s new compensation terms to provide a focused incentive to increase shareholder value.

Concludingly, we notice a significant increase in various performance shares, restricted shares, short-term incentive plans, stock options and long term incentive plans for the insiders of the company. For the exact SEC filing and handout, I refer to the Seeking Alpha link above as the document is too extensive to go through in full detail. We note, however, that various incentive plans have a strike price above $45 and even above $70, as well as stock options that allow management to buy additional shares. Combining these findings with the fact that incentives of Livewire are aligned with the incentives of the Harley-Davidson board, we notice that insiders in both the spinoff as the parent that spinsoff the company are highly aligned towards increased shareholder value, even more so compared to other periods...

**4. CONCLUSION**

Combining our due dilligence above, we arrive at the following outtakes:

* Harley- Davidson currently has a stock price of $36.40 – $7.01 in cash per share = $29.39 (i.e. investors only pay $29 dollars for the entire business of Harley-Davidson)
* Harley-Davidson has a business division that is likely to spinoff in Q2 2022 in which it will hold a 74% stake, currently valued at $9.7 per share. The spinoff company is **undervalued** relatively to its peers. If the spinoff company is to be valued compared to its peers, this would value the spinoff company even more than the entire business of Harley-Davidson (i.e. investors could buy Harley-Davidson shares for the spinoff company and receive the entire Harley-Davidson company for free). At a $10B valuation ($20B), this would mean a value of $48.5 ($97) of Livewire per share of Harley-Davidson.
* Management has strong incentives to increase shareholder value for both Livewire and Harley Davidson. Incentives are structured above the $70 per share region.
* Revenues and therefore valuation of the spinoff company is expected to increase exponentially as Livewire is the first publicly traded EV motorcycle company.
* Even when all of the above would seem trivial, Harley-Davidson is **undervalued** and remains a value buy based upon its own principals. You would even reap some nice dividends rewards of 1.73$.

Simple math and logic, combined with the skill to think indepently and think correctly are the only skills an investor needs. At the current price and situation, this seems to be the perfect specific situation that Joel Greenblatt described in his book.You can read up on the entire blogpost at the link below: [https://eurykleiainvestments.com/blog/my-due-dilligence-on-harley-davidson/](https://eurykleiainvestments.com/blog/my-due-dilligence-on-harley-davidson/)",txwwaq,0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/txwwaq/my_due_dilligence_on_harleydavidson_hog/

Obviously there's interest rate risk, but since that mostly seems linked to the Fed fighting higher than expected inflation, I'm having trouble deciding how much of an issue that is.

2889,Warner Media Discovery: Would the sale of WB Games require disclosure to the market/gov prior to the deal being approved?,,"In May 2021, it was announced that Warner Bros. would be merging with Discovery to form Warner Media Discovery.  The company received FTC approval back in February 2022, and shareholder approval a week or two ago.  The deal is set to formally close in mid-late April 2022.  

Over the past couple years it's been rumored that WB Games would be sold off to a Microsoft, Sony, etc.  After the WMD merger deal was announced, WB came out and said that WB Games would not be sold off.  I guess my question is for how long does this statement have to be true such that they could not be successfully sued for securities fraud, etc.?  

In other words:

* Once the deal closes are they free to sell off WB Games?  
* If the sell-off of a WB Games studio were in the works prior to the merger closing, would disclosure of this potential transaction have been required?  
* If WB Games were sold off some time in the future, could shareholders sue on the basis that they approved the deal with the understanding that WB Games would not be sold off? 

Just curious how this all works from a regulatory/legal standpoint.  Many thanks for any insight.",ttcnqe,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ttcnqe/warner_media_discovery_would_the_sale_of_wb_games/

2893,Ban on Russian metals ?,Discussion,"Hi everybody,

Following Russian's invasion of Ukraine, massive and coordinated sanctions have been imposed over Russia, in a lot of domains including the crucial energy sector.

Despite initial reluctance of some European countries which rely on Russian energy (Germany for instance), ban of oil and gas have been decided and US & European countries are now deploying massive efforts to remove this dependence (EU is dealing with middle-east gas, and US is even considering dealing again with Venezuelan oil).

&#x200B;

However, up to now the Russian mining industry has not been sanctioned yet.

Mining industry is a huge sector in Russian economy with groups such as Rusal (6% of world aluminum production) or Norilsk Nickel (20% of world nickel production, 75% of world palladium production). Furthermore these groups are controlled by Russian oligarchs who have not been sanctioned yet neither.

These groups provide a huge source of income for Russia, and sanctions could be very effective.

Now that bans have even been imposed on the Russian energy sector (and despite that has been said before on these bans, alternatives are being/have already been found to replace Russian energy sources), what could prevent the same to be applied on mining sector ?

&#x200B;

Is there a possibility that this sector is kept for future sanctions to make them effective ? I barely see every Russian sector being banned (even the main ones), except for this single one industry.

&#x200B;

Here is my thoughts in case of ban on Russian metals :

* Metals with high Russian markets shares (nickel, palladium…) will spike due to :
   * Supply shorts caused by the sudden removal of large amount of Russian metals from the market
   * Unchanged and strong demand (for instance, nickel is necessary for battery production, metallurgy, chemical industry and aeronautics, and demand is expected to have a substantial growth in the next years to support energy transition)
* By consequence, investors (and sectors mentioned above which need these metals to pursue their activities) will actively look for short and long-term alternatives to replace Russian metals and make the supply satisfy the demand
* This could highly benefits to some non-Russian sources such as VALE, BHP, RIO, TMC (the last one is an example of smaller cap but with a huge potential source of nickel in the future).

These stocks could be great opportunities in case of sanction and surge on nickel/palladium/copper price.

So, what are you thoughts about sanctions on Russian mining industry and its consequences ?",tpeoig,0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tpeoig/ban_on_russian_metals/

First is the LINK to the chart below: [https://optionstrat.com/build/diagonal-put-spread/MULN/220414P4x-11,220520P2x30](https://optionstrat.com/build/diagonal-put-spread/MULN/220414P4x-11,220520P2x30)

Stock: MULN

Sell 11 Contracts DTE 4/14/22 at $1.53 = $1683 Premium collected

Buy 30 Contracts DTE 5/20/22 at $0.48 = ($1440) Premium paid

Premium kept = $243

Looking into the Optionstrat chart, max loss is ($180.41) should it expires within the breakevens. Am I wrong to think I can pay for the loss ($180.41) with the premium kept $243 and still come out positive despite ""losing"" on the trade?

What am I missing here?

2896,My option and analysis on JD and DADA,,"updated the whole analysis and tables [here](https://www.westmoney.com/share/stocknewsdetail?id=956495782389878784&lang=en&color=1&wm=reddit):

JD is the leaders among other O2O platform in supermarket segment with a market shares of 27%. They also have now established partnership with 85 out of the top 100 supermarket chains in China. The gap between JDDJ and the second and third players remained wide at 11 and 18 % points respectfully. Thus, I believe that Dada will benefits from this overall trends as they are the leaders in the space.

Dada also posted a very good Q4 results with net revenues from Dada Now achieved a RMB718 million. This represent a pro forma revenue growth rate of 80.5% yearover-year, mainly driven by increases in order volume of intra-city delivery services to chain merchants. Net revenues from JDDJ also increased by 80.1% to RMB1.3 billion, mainly due to the increase in GMV, which was driven by increases in the number of active consumers and average order size. The increase in online marketing services revenues as a result of the increasing promotional activities launched also contributed to the revenue growth of JD.

In terms of the outlook, For the first quarter of 2022, Dada expect a total revenue to be between RMB2 billion and RMB2.05 billion, representing a pro forma growth rate of 72% to 76% The reason why the company used a pro forma growth rate to evaluate the company is because of effective from April 2021, the cost of riders for last-mile delivery services has been directly paid through third-party companies instead of through the Company. The Company no longer recognizes rider-related revenue and rider-related costs in the income statement for the last-mile delivery services.

**Valuation**

According to analyst estimates, even though the company is heavily burning money, but it was suprising that analyst is expected the company started to generate profit in 2023 and currently Dada has a forward 2023 PE ratio of 29.67. If the company were able to achieve those results and become profitable in 2023, I would believe that the company would be a good buy because of the big total addressable market and the high growth rate of the industry.

However, I remain sceptical about the company achieving profitability soon, as on the latest quarter results of the company, they are no sign of the company slowing its cash burning activities. The sector is very challenging and with a low switching cost if there are no offers or coupons made or given by the platform. This results in consistent cash burning in order to retain the consumer on the platform, thus I will wait until the company shows that it has the road to achieve profitability before I invest in the company.",tlzq1s,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tlzq1s/my_option_and_analysis_on_jd_and_dada/
2897,Trouble choosing a broker and having trouble switching.,," Hello,  I have a tough time figuring out what broker to use and I  don’t know  why since the obvious answer is Fidelity or TDAmeritrade. I  am  currently with Charles Schwab for my broker using their   StreetSmartEdge.  My uncle referred me to them and I’ve been using the  ever since I started investing and day trading back in September of   2020. They are also my only bank, but starting to move funds over to   Fidelity since I have some retirement accounts with them and to see how  they are. I like Schwab’s platform but it has issues. I’ve ran into some  problems with them, such as placing orders above the ask price and it  not filling when it should have like today it should have filled for the  few seconds my order was up, but they didn’t go through. Or orders  being filled but taking a few seconds to even show up and I have to  close the desktop application on windows and log in again to see if the  order shows I have a position in the stock and it shows it since I  re-started the program. I don’t use Mac OS because StreetSmartEdge is  cloud-based for Mac and it’s slow. Or like a couple of times so far when  I  logged on and the chart, level 2 info, and time and sales being  behind  by a couple to a few minutes of what Fidelity is showing even  though the chart on Schwab and time and sales are showing the present  time just the chart values are off, so I restart the program and the  information is all right all of a sudden. Almost every time this happens  I get mad and say I’m going to go to Fidelity, but it never happens.

Today   I sort of had enough of Schwab’s platform and think I’m going to  really move to Fidelity. Today I submitted about 7 buy orders before the  opening bell well above the ask price by a few cents and they didn’t  fill, I got really mad. The Schwab broker said something like the only  way the order didn’t fill is the exchange didn’t have any sellers below  my limit price which is total BS because there weren’t any other sellers  above my limit price and I doubt there weren’t any NASDAQ  sellers at  the time and then goes on to say they had issues with orders/  routing  them this morning before the bell for like 10-15 minutes.  Schwab has,  again and again, had issues.  Apparently, Schwab and  TDAmeritrade will  be “become one” the representative said like these two companies will  finally merge in about the summertime of 2023 and then 12  months later  Schwab and TDA clients will be able to trade using either   StreetSmartEdge or TOS with their same account. So I can use TOS one day  and SSE the next which is cool, but yeah the problems they have. I’m  not really wanting to wait for that just to use TOS.

I  day trade Triple Leverage ETFs on margin, almost completely on margin  so some cash but barely any. Usually, the max I do is 56% margin against  my securities, with Schwab the margin requirement amount for triple  leveraged ETFs are 70% but that’s overnight. Last week I accidentally  went with a little over 100% margin with these triple leveraged ETFs for  a second. I love the thrill of always having a somewhat predictable  security that makes big swings constantly throughout the day. Sometimes I  place a directed trade so not an auto routed smart trade to buy or sell  and immediately as I place the trade the price goes in the direction I  want it, but my order isn’t filled and I need to place another order  with a higher limit price, so either I am really good at knowing when to  get it and I can see I am good at that, but feels like there’s a PFOF  going on? Idk.

I  think I’ll move  over the Fidelity, just Schwab seems to be great at mostly everything  except for their platform has issues and I have a hard  time changing  things in my life sometimes.

I  don’t like having to wait 31 days while switching brokers and not being  able to trade these triple leveraged ones to have to avoid cost basis  information and all that mess it’ll cause, but I  might just have to  wait.

2905,Stock picks for Income generation and boosted returns in 2022,,"With everything going on in the world right now (Russian invasion, supply chain shortages, staggering inflation, interest rate hikes, etc) the markets can seem pretty uncertain. And you might be wondering *what am I gonna do? I'm down 15% YTD, that's basically half of last year's return figures.*

Well I have a solution, or more technically, something that I conceived while studying backtests and options data by people much smarter than me.

What's the solution? Selling puts.

I see you rolling your eyes, *this guy thinks he's a genius for discovering CSPs, what a moron.*

Something you might not have heard before is that CSPs outperform in both bear and stagnant markets. So while in the last couple years CSPs have underperformed relative to growth stocks, *when not if* the market reverses the pendulum will swing back towards CSPs outperforming.

[https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.4882&rep=rep1&type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.4882&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

If you read the article, you can also note another important thing on page 50. CSPs also realize a much lower standard deviation, in fact, it happens to be **50% lower** when compared to the S&P 500.

So what does it mean when you match the annualized returns (or sometimes slightly outperform) the overall index while also having a lower standard deviation? We lower the Sharpe ratio! Which makes our portfolio have better risk adjusted returns.

So now we get to my twist. If you sell CSPs on the index you get better risk adjusted returns, but what if we now want to raise our returns to a point where we have the same risk exposure as the overall market?

We concentrate our holdings. Rather than holding the entire index we hold less stocks, which increases our standard deviation, but at the same time should also raise our returns. Now I may have lost some of you at this point saying to shy away from indexes, but bear with me a little longer.

*We don't need 500 stocks to be fully diversified.*

According to this article where they randomly picked stocks within certain indexes and then calculated the standard deviation based on the number of holdings, *the ideal number of holdings for large caps is between 15 and 26.*

[*https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2021/05/06/peak-diversification-how-many-stocks-best-diversify-an-equity-portfolio/*](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2021/05/06/peak-diversification-how-many-stocks-best-diversify-an-equity-portfolio/)

So that's the sweet spot, we find high yielding CSPs on blue chip stocks inside already built indexes like the S&P 500 and then pick between 15-26 of them to improve our returns.

Conveniently, I've built a handy tool in Python that screens for these options within the indexes (which you can find in my post history [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/lzklj8/i_created_an_options_screener_for_csps_and_ccs/)) that uses Robinhood's unofficial API. I more recently rebuilt the whole project again using Python again, but this time with TDAmeritrade's API which is actually made for pulling options data.

So using that tool, I'm gonna lay out five CSP option plays that I would make for the next month.

**Sell CCL $15P 04/14/2022 for $29 to capture a 1.93% ROI**

This company has had some bad earnings since the pandemic started, but I think that it still is a good company with a low PB ratio at 1.65. As people return to their normal lives in the coming years they will want to go on cruises again.

**Sell GPS $13P 04/14/2022 for $22 to capture a 1.69% ROI**

This company also suffered from the pandemic, but is starting to make a recovery. Their PE ratio sits at 21.3 and PB ratio at 2.44.

**Sell FANG $105P 04/14/2022 for $177 to capture a 1.69% ROI**

Oil and gas company, pretty self explanatory. War makes oil prices go BRRR. PE ratio: 11.2 PB ratio: 1.58

**Sell KMX $80P 04/14/2022 for $120 to capture a 1.5% ROI**

Carmax is a retailer of used cars. With new cars suffering awful supply chain shortages, most people will be buying from sites like this for awhile. PE ratio: 14.2 PB ratio: 4.47

**Sell F $14P 04/14/2022 for $21 to capture a 1.5% ROI**

Ford is coming up with some great new vehicles. Their Mustang Mach-E gave Tesla a run for their money and they won't stop there. Their sales are also way up from where they were. PE ratio: 3.79 PB ratio: 1.76

Another thing to note, the prices at which I say to sell this options are subject to fluctuation, if you try to sell them on market open tomorrow the prices most likely will have changed. If you want to know if the option still offers a good ROI just take the option contract price and divide it by the strike prices times 100. Then just convert that number to a percentage.

The stock was the most bought U.S. stock by retail investors on Monday.

Justin Post, an analyst at Bank of America, said: ""Given the amount of attention Musk has received on social platforms and other media, we expect this news (buying a stake in Twitter) to drive a lot of retail investor interest and investment in the stock. ""

However, the analyst also warned that the hype could also attract investors who like to short stocks. In addition, Musk's move to buy Twitter shares has fueled another wave of investor hype over meme stocks. In addition to Twitter, retail investors also took the opportunity to buy meme stocks such as Game Station (GME.N) and AMC Cinemas (AMC.N).",typivi,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/typivi/after_musks_blessing_retail_investors_scramble_to/

Silly question for a lot of you I'm sure but for a long time I've been calculating CAGR, on a period from say March 2013 to March 2022 (10-years worth of data), with 10 being the number of years in the calculation.

However, recently I picked up a copy of Phil Town's Rule 1 and Payback Time and it wasn't quite adding up. Then I read where he says that he subtracts 1 from the 10 years, so instead of the numbers of years in the calculation being 10 it would be 9. I also found it in his PDF here: [https://www.ruleoneinvesting.com/ExcelFormulas.pdf](https://www.ruleoneinvesting.com/ExcelFormulas.pdf)

&#x200B;

>*""If we have a 10-year average growth rate, then you add up the number of years worth of data you have (10) then subtract 1. This means you would put a 9 in the nper section...""*

2927,Forecasting Fuel Prices: Best Methods?,," I‘m looking to forecast fuel prices for a long term play in the downstream energy sector. I want to forecast pricing 5 years out.

The approach I plan on taking is to look at historical refined product cracks (the spread between crude and gasoline/diesel) over the last 4 years and average them out, I will then layer on demand destruction on gasoline using a 1 to 1 application of demand destruction to pricing (i.e. if demand is forecasted to drop by 1%, refined product margin will drop 1%) and the same for diesel (where demand likely increases). After that I can take that and apply those margins to an aggregate of crude forecasts that exist out there (I don’t want to get into trying to predict oil prices) which should then give me a total product price which I can then apply inflation to. Once I have product prices, I might adjust the demand destruction assumptions if prices are forecasted to test all time highs.

Does that sound logical to the experts out there? Seems pretty simplistic but it’s how I used to do it in my former life. I’m curious if there are ways to improve this.",tt5bis,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tt5bis/forecasting_fuel_prices_best_methods/

I’m 28 years old and rent in a different city in FL, have a well-paying job, and am overall doing well financially. My idea is to scale this investment and not use it for anything personal. 

On one hand, I can build a house on the lot (approx. 300k), save in agent fees and some closing costs, then either sell or rent it out when it’s completed a year later, depending on the market. On the other hand, I can sell it now, have that money on hand to shop around for a single-family home in a different FL city. I could either rinse and repeat or rent it out. The FL market is absolutely crazy right now though. I don’t see it slowing down but if something were to happen, I’d be waiting for the construction to finish and be stuck with an expensive mortgage. I like the idea of having the money to shop around for the right deal but maybe I’m approaching this wrong? Maybe the best thing would be to throw it into a fund or other investment type.

Edit: [Morningstar.com](https://Morningstar.com) currently has Meta listed as being 42% below fair value, which is just insane to me. My previous statement was not accurate.

Do you think it's a buy in general?

I'm pretty bullish on the Metaverse, because I've seen what vrchat can do, and the whole situation there reminds me of League of Legends taking over from DOTA. In that situation, Riot gaming basically took the model built by an entire network of community software developers, added their capital and profit motive, and created an extremely dominant and powerful game which has a Netflix series and professional and amateur e-sports teams across the globe.

On top of that, we live in a post-covid and highly globalized world, where people are much more accepting of using digital interfaces, like zoom, to socialize.

But for now I am wondering what I can do with my IRAs which I funded back in the States.  I cannot fund them with foreign income.

The IRAs were with T Rowe Price and I transferred them to a Charles Schwab One (international) account because I wanted to trade them out of the expensive T Rowe Price SP500 mutual fund into something a Schwab ETF SP500 with a lower fee.  The transfer went fine but Schwab will not let me make any trades.  So now I have two T Rowe Price mutual funds with all my retirement savings sitting in a Schwab account and the only thing Schwab will allow me to do is sell them!  Super annoying.

This is some kind of FACTA rule which I do not fully understand.  According the Schwab advisor I neither have to move back to the States or become a German citizen to trade the damn things. 

What I was thinking of doing is moving them back to T. Rowe Price as my account there is still open and registered using my mother's American address as my legal residence.  T. Rowe Price will be none the wiser and then I can at least trade into another T. Rowe Price fund, although those are not super great in my opinion.  But I am going to guess that lying on an IRA transfer form some major financial crime that the IRS would love to punish my small-time ass for, while Panama Papers folks buy a third yacht.

2956,Dividends - Monthly or Quarterly ?,,"I understand the basics of dividends and compound interest so I know that, for an identical dividend amount it's always better to pick something that pays a monthly dividend. What has got me thinking is how to figure out which is better when one is monthly and the other is quarterly. I'll make an abstract example to illustrate my point:

Imagine an asset that pays a monthly dividend of $0.46, an amount roughly equal to 0.75% the cost of one share. 

Imagine a second asset that pays a quarterly dividend of $0.47, an amount roughly equal to 2.78% the cost of one share. 

Which would be the better investment? Would it be better to purchase one of the first asset, or three of the second asset at roughly the same price? 

For the curious, my examples are loosely based upon JEPI and PMT.",tr50xw,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tr50xw/dividends_monthly_or_quarterly/

2964,How to Invest in a Bear Market? – Advice from a Veteran Fund Manager with 54 years of Experience,Discussion,"If you are heavily invested in China Tech, it is not an easy time in the past few weeks. Baba has fallen by 30% within a week and the end seems not in sight. Even the almighty Tencent was not spared from this perfect storm.

The reasons for their drop could be from the possible implications of delisting from the US, China’s regulatory claw and the more likely cause which is similar sanctions imposed on Russia slapped on the Chinese companies.

Would the US and its allies impose drastic sanctions on China? Based on a realistic assessment, it is unlikely to happen as China is playing the neutral role well so far. However, it was also unlikely too for Russia to wage a war on Ukraine without negotiations so it is anyone’s guess in this crazy world.

We have low interest rates but a new system that covers the fall of Turkish lira compared to US dollars and pays the difference to you in full. But the payment is done by printing money so i think we are on the verge of a huge hyperinflation. Should i wait for black market cash euro sell or hyperinflation, instead of buying a house? Is there a housing price bubble in Turkey? Will the prices of houses drop? Will i be able to buy more with the euros that i have in a crisis situation?

2969,"How to defer capital gain taxes, forever (Europe)",,"Let's cut to the chase. I like trading options, even for things that I'd normally intend to buy-and-hold forever. Eg think the most boomer ETF, but with covered calls.

This is fine, but there's a big difference between a but-and-hold strategy, wrt taxation. Buy-and-hold doesn't realize capital gains. Selling LEAPS calls and letting them expire worthless, *does*.

Is there any trick that one can use to get the taxation benefits of buy-and-hold while realizing (necessarily, since they expire) gains from options? I'm talking about continental Europe, there are no ""wash sale"" rules here, nor ""short term"" vs ""long term"" rules.

I've seen the trick where one opens a short and a long position on essentially the same underlying, hoping that one of the sides will be deep in the negative (while the other similarly in the green, of course), then that one can be used to realize a loss, say on Dec 31st, while the other can be closed on Jan 1st (with some overnight risk there), hence one harvests a realized loss in year N for the cost of higher realized gain in year N+1. But maybe the same trick can be used year-over-year? If someone manages to do this, which market/positions you use a instruments and why?

Any other ideas?

**EDIT**: the more I contemplate this, the more it seems to work. The key details (where the devil lies) is what instruments would be used to create large enough unrealized gains & losses, and cancel each other out. Whether such instruments would be two tickers, or whether they could be built via options. And what would be the overnight risk between Dec 31 to Jan 1, when an unhedged position would need to remain open. 

Futures don't seem to work, since (I think) they can't be used to create long-term unrealized gains/losses; they are marked-to-market frequently (daily). Which is a pity, because futures usually trade almost 24/7.

Cryptos would be another interesting possibility (24/7 trading), but it's hard to create a long AND short position, via the same broker (and it would be better to have everything in the same account, for margin reasons).

So, I can't think of a good solution that trades 24/7.

Who created Google's world's largest smartphone operating system - Android? Achieved Google's market leadership in smartphone operating systems for the next 10-20 years.

&#x200B;

Andy Rubin, a computer science graduate from Utica College in New York State, came to Apple in 1989 at the age of 26. He and several other colleagues developed Magic Cap with great success, but because Magic Cap was too advanced to adapt to the market. Rubin's R&D department was forced to disintegrate.

After Rubin joined three Apple veterans established Artemis research and development company. The product he was involved in developing was WebTV, an interactive Internet television. In 1997, Artemis was acquired by Microsoft. Rubin stayed at Microsoft. In 1999, Rubin left Microsoft.

&#x200B;

In October 2003, Andy Rubin joined several friends to create the Android company and put all his savings into it.

Andy Rubin put Android's business plan to be free to mobile phone manufacturers open, and then sell value-added services to operators.

Android, which is short of investment, has accepted Google's acquisition proposal, which is said to be priced at $50 million. On July 11, 2005, the Android team moved into Google.

&#x200B;

But something big happened along the way. Apple launched its smartphone in January 2007, and it went on sale in June 2007.

&#x200B;

On September 22, 2008, Google officially released the first Android phone HTC G1, also known as HTC Dream. By the end of 2010, Android, which was only three years old, had surpassed Nokia's Symbian system, which had dominated for a decade.

&#x200B;

In 2014, Rubin left Google to invest in his own startup incubation company.

All my deals I open on DEXs like Pangolin, Mimo, WOWswap. For trading with leverage (more often short deals on BTC) i use WOWswap.

A correction is needed to pump the market more volume. Let's look at the facts, bitcoin can't get above the $44,000 level for over a month, and the local low keeps breaking new marks. Obviously, the squeeze is coming soon, but up or down is not for us to decide. But for growth it is always necessary to gather something from weak hands, we all know it.

i think something similar may be happening right now with tech: FAANGs may be down 20-30% but a lot of SaaS companies are down more than 50%.

i don't know which ones will do the best, i'm not sure that i have the drive to research them, so my plan:

take $10k, divide it evenly into names like SNOW, NET, CRM, OKTA, S, RBLX, CRWD, maybe some others.

2995,CoinBase Is Stupid. Crypto currencies are stupid.,," **I have no vendetta against anybody from CoinBase, nor do I hold any position in any company. I have been hearing about this crypto crap since 2016/17 when I was starting at grad school, but really didn't care much at that point. More recently, when I felt I had been a victim of some crypto fraud (i.e. my identity had been compromised), I decided to take this personally.**  I could really attack any company that has crypto roots, but since CoinBase is the ""[Amazon](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/company/amazon)"" or ""Uber"" of its industry (that is to say the most recognizable name in the space), I am focusing my efforts on it. Again, I don't care if Jim Simmons has invested in the company or Warren Buffet did (though he hasn't), if it doesn't make any economic sense, it is not worth investing in.    


1. Retail Users: Retail users are driving bulk of the activity here. 32% of the [trading](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/finance-dictionary/trading-overview) volume is coming from them and it makes up 94% of the transaction revenue. Retail and institutional guys are lumped under ""verified users"", but their criteria for verified users is ridiculous (it is essentially anybody who has provided an email address or a phone number or some other information). It's really not that time-consuming to open an email account, and as they themselves state, they don't know how many ""unique"" verified users or MTU are on their platform. So for all you know, maybe 100 or 200 folks are driving bulk of the activity here, and they are clearly doing no due diligence checks to verify the identity/finances of the users. I don't know how are Robinhood's onboarding measures different, but Robinhood clearly asks for Social Security number (at least that's what I remember it asking for in 2016), and it seems the barriers to trading here are very low on CoinBase. Why this matters? Because it potentially opens them up to a bunch of lawsuits, which are already in the action and 2) they may potentially be overstating their key business metrics (not potentially, definitely)   


2. Litigation: Company has 3/4 legal proceedings either going against it or has been threatened with. Truly an innovative and cutting-edge company to be dealing with litigation issues at the start of its public life. I can only imagine what other marvelous moments are ahead of it    


3. Security: Clearly the company has not been paying much attention to the security hacks that happen on this platform otherwise they would have created a provision for them or had some sort of reserve to deal with these situations. For their crypto asset wallets, they state the risk of loss is remote. How do you reconcile this with the litigation proceedings that the company has going on? There is a disconnect here   


4. Salaries: Maybe I am looking at the wrong place here, but I can't find the cash compensation of the management team, so I am assuming that the salaries they mention their are cash compensations. Brian Armstrong is getting paid $1 million in base, the salary of Zoom CEO (arguably a shitty company too but at least has a relevant use) is $300K. But what surprises me the most is that they don't have a chief security officer or anyone listed there on the management, and 2) the salary for chief legal officer (one of the more important guys in this business) is \~200K. I am not really factoring in stock options here or any of that stuff because I really think CoinBase is worthless and will be going down. I don't think Brian understands the risks inherent in this business or he would be paying his chief legal officer more here     


5. Technology & Development: This is where I am assuming that security expenses are being included, but it's not abundantly clear to me. They say: ""technology and development expenses include personnel-related expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, and enhancing our platform. These costs also include website hosting, infrastructure expenses, costs incurred in developing new products and services and the amortization of acquired developed technology"". I don't think the company regards security of the platform vital enough otherwise they would be drawing more investor attention to it.  


6. Valuation: Their valuation of their crypto assets is amusingly funny. I am not an accountant, but I find it ridiculous that they value the assets on their book based off the closing on the last day of the respective period. So where are you capturing the volatility in the crypto markets? Dumb. And. Wrong.    


7. Disclosure: As I said before, their disclosure sucks. 31% of the assets on their platform are ""other crypto assets"" and make up 50% of their revenues. But no breakdown on these other assets. I don't know the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum and Lithium and Sodium and Potassium (all the fucking elements of the Chemistry table), but some of you schmucks might know. However, for a company that is making 50% of its revenue from two assets (Bitcoin and Ethereum), it should talk about each in more detail and what separates them. Nothing. This revenue / asset concentration is nothing to write about.     


8. Acquisition: OK I am not dissecting all the acquisitions they've made nor have I researched them. But in January 2022, they made an acquisition of 257 million of which 151 or something was in cash. Why pay in cash if you think think your stock is worth more? Dunno, doesn't make much sense to me.   

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The fact that this asset class (Bitcoin/Ethereum) is at this price or that doesn't matter. 

Before you plow your money into this crap, ask yourself or whoever is asking you to invest in this crap, the following questions:  

**Valuation:**

* How do you ascribe value to these crypto currencies (please help me understand the valuation employed and the assumptions that go into it)?
* What is the difference between Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin? Why is one valued higher than the other? What is each bitcoin's competitive moat?
* What investment time horizon do you recommend, and why?

**Legal:**

* How do you ensure that these currencies or the exchanges they're traded on are not immune to either security hacks or other kinds (by now, cases of multi-billion / million dollar hacks seem to be a common phenomenon), how does one ensure that this does not happen?
* How do you suggest you do due diligence on the parties involved in these transactions, as they seem to be keen on remaining hidden from the public eye?

**Commercial:**

* How further long before all major central banks / governments around the world endorse Crypto as a part of their overall monetary policy framework? In a situation where it is not commonly accepted by all, what risks do you see playing out?
* What reserve currency will these crypto assets be pegged to and why? If USD, why, as bulk of the activity seems to be concentrated in Asia here?
* How do you differentiate between what is ""fake"" crypto currency and what is ""real"" crypto currency unlike the litmus test that exists for commodities (gold etc.)?  

**Accounting / Taxation / Insurance:**

* How does one ensure transparent and correct financial reporting of these crypto assets (in terms of accounting)? How should one be reporting the value of these crypto assets on one's tax returns?
* What's right mark-to-market approach for these assets?

**Others:**

* How do you convince someone , who's not a sophisticated and / or an accredited investor, that investing in crypto assets is a better use of capital as opposed to investing in even more hard, tangible assets (real estate) or non-riskier (as well as non-volatile, and more transparent investment options: government bonds, [ETF](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/finance-dictionary/what-is-an-exchange-traded-fund-ETF) / index funds)    
* Why is there a need for crypto / bitcoins when the existing forms of payment (hard cash, soft cash) seem to be acceptable by most? I am really hoping that the answer to this question is not that a bunch of millennials / generation Z want to ""own"" something different, and so everyone jumped on the bandwagon to make that happen. 

I doubt you're going to get any seemingly intelligent answer to any of these, which does not make this worth your time/effort/investment. I don't know when will this dooms day arrive, but the price of this thing will soon be down going the gutter.

2996,Is investing in ETF/ Index funds really worth it for the long term?,,"I’m 24 and live with my parents, and I’m in a good spot financially. No debt, and great at saving money. I have been hesitant to invest in an ETF/ Index funds for one main reason.

Let’s say I’m to invest 100 dollars a day into funds such as VOO, VTI, or FXIAX. Essentially in roughly 27-30 years I would have invested enough money to average 100 dollars a day in passive income. My math is more than likely wrong, but I’m just using it as an example. So 100 dollars a day sounds great as passive income, but what will 3,000 dollars a month get me 30 years from now? Inflation will continue to grow, and what will become of my investment?

Please correct me if I’m wrong, as I’m still learning about the stock market. To me it just feels a little bit pointless to invest so much, and end up getting very little in the future. It’s obviously better than letting it sit in the bank and depreciate value, but would it just be better to save my money and pursue real estate?

3000,Russian ADR/GDR securities - can I buy/sell them directly and not through exchange?,Discussion,"Hello community,

&#x200B;

As you probably know, since March 1st, all Russian GDR/ADR securities have been suspended from trading all over the world stock exchanges.

So nobody can buy/sell them (some brokers allow only-close actions, but due to lack of buyers - the prices are near zero).

As per the recent Russian govenment's law - all Russian GDR/ADR securities has to be cancelled: all the receits owners will receive the stocks/shares instead of their GDR/ADR securities.  
However, for non-russian resedents it's not an easy procedure: it's not clear how they will receive the shares/stocks if they do not have an account with a russian broker.

I know some traders would like to get rid of russian securities but have no chance to sell them on decent price (current prices at LSE near zero).  


Is there a way that an owner of Russian GDR/ADR may sell it to another person (p2p transaction) ?

&#x200B;

3001,how do ETFs choose their allocation percentage?,,"My biggest problem with ETFs is that they tend to be too diverse. I want exposure to a sector... But, i don't want 25+ companies. I just to mimic a passive ETF's to 5 or 10 holdings.

That got me to thinking: how do they determine 4% to this company, 2.8% to that company, etc? I'm not interested in any ""you aren't as smart as them"" comments. I'm still trying to figure out an investing style that works for me, so even if you think its a dumb idea, I'd be interested in understanding how passive ETF indexing works.",tvelt4,0,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tvelt4/how_do_etfs_choose_their_allocation_percentage/

3005,"Let's peel apart the February 2022 7.9% CPI measurement to figure out if the data shows ""it's because the fed printed money""",,"Stuff in 2021 cost 7.9% less than it did in 2022. Let's investigate:

> The CPI-U is a more general index and seeks to track retail prices as they affect all urban consumers. It encompasses about 87 percent of the United States' population. The CPI-W is a more specialized index and seeks to track retail prices as they affect urban hourly wage earners and clerical workers.

> The three largest components of the CPI are housing, transportation, and food/beverages in that order.

> They are weighted this way: housing 41.4%; food and beverages 17.4%; transport 17.0%; medical care 6.9%; apparel 6.0%; recreation 4.4%; other 6.9%. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index

How much is each category up?

    Housing (CPIHOSNS): 275.13 -> 291.50 (5.95%)
    Food and beverages (CPIUFDSL): 271.42 -> 292.91 (7.9%)
    Transport (CPITRNSL): 211.47 -> 256.02 (21.06%)
    Medical care (CPIMEDSL): 523.03 -> 535.73 (2.43%)
    Apparel (CPIAPPSL): 118.53 -> 126.34 (6.59%)
    Recreation (CPIRECSL): 122.89 -> 128.97 (4.97%)
    Other (CPIOGSSL): 469.88 -> 496.04 (5.57%)

2021: (41.4×275.13+17.4×271.42+17×211.47+6.9×523.03+6×118.53+4.4×122.89+6.9×469.88) / (41.4+17.4+17+6.9+6+4.4+6.9) = 278.11055

2022: (41.4×291.50+17.4×292.91+17×256.02+6.9×535.73+6×126.34+4.4×128.97+6.9×496.04) / (41.4+17.4+17+6.9+6+4.4+6.9) = 299.61795

My weights are a little outdated/off but the math checks out: about 7.7% increase 2021 -> 2022

Now let's dive into some of the categories. A lot of people say CPI is a shitty metric that doesn't capture the ""true"" inflation Americans are experiencing. I've read countless times on Reddit how the entire formula is set up in a way to hide ""real inflation"" from the American people.

Here are the same categories, sorted by how much they are up year over year:

    (21.06%) Transport (CPITRNSL): 211.47 -> 256.02 
    (7.9%) Food and beverages (CPIUFDSL): 271.42 -> 292.91  
    (6.59%) Apparel (CPIAPPSL): 118.53 -> 126.34  
    (5.95%) Housing (CPIHOSNS): 275.13 -> 291.50  
    (5.57%) Other (CPIOGSSL): 469.88 -> 496.04 
    (4.97%) Recreation (CPIRECSL): 122.89 -> 128.97  
    (2.43%) Medical care (CPIMEDSL): 523.03 -> 535.73  

Obviously, housing matters more to people than apparel. Keep in mind the transport category is what holds gasoline prices, and this was a reading before the Ukraine-Russia conflict if I remember correctly.

March 2022 CPI will be released Apr. 12, 2022.

Drilling in a bit more, here are some categories. The weights might be slightly out of date, since the page says it is from 2020. https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2020.htm The categories are up to 8 tiers nested.

3014,which do u think are the best startups,,"I'm looking to invest in eight different startups, but I'd like to know your thoughts about which companies will likely become successful in the long-run. Advance thanks to those who will provide their suggestions! :)

**1.** **Startup #1**

This startup company develops an app that matches students who have free time to run little errands with students who don't. In-app cash will be assigned to each errand (similar to debits and credits).

**2. Startup #2**

The project entails developing an application that gathers information about location, availability, and charges from of the websites of car-sharing businesses (such as Evo, Cars to Go, and Zipcar).

**3.** **Startup #3**

The project entails developing an application that gathers fashion clothing goods in one place and allows users to compare what they want to what is available. The concept is based on a Spanish application of a similar nature.

**4.** **Startup #4**

The plan is to open a restaurant where customers will be able to reserve their own booth and choose their own music, atmosphere, and food. There will be no servers, and the food will be delivered via a booth conveyer in the wall. The concept is to provide a one-of-a-kind integrated experience that is tailored to the needs of each individual guest.

**5.** **Startup #5**

The project involves offering meals to students who do not know/do not want to cook/go to restaurant/have a takeout. The meals will be delivered on an agreed-upon weekly schedule.

**6.** **Startup #6**

The goal of the project is to develop an app that will pair students with similar interests and lifestyles as housemates (in apartments and houses). The programme will provide extensive matching criteria as well as a roommate rating system.

**7.** **Startup #7**

3018,"Law regarding exemption from CG (bad formatting, from phone)",,"I'm writing this to ask the community if anyone knows if what I recall has any merit or if it's just plain wrong.

Some time ago I read a paper about funds that avoided some form of taxation (CG I believe is the most likely) by never holding stocks overnight, hence only capturing daily movements (which is itself strange as for the last 20 years, SPY daily is almost flat while most of the gains happen overnight).

If this strategy permits the exemption from a particular type of taxation, then it could have some merit.

This strategy could have to do with the fact that in the US, the redemption of appreciated stocks to a partner, such as a broker, from a mutual fund is treated by the IRS as a tax-exempt event.

I also can't recall if it was about the US or European market.

This memory is from a long time ago, I apologize if it's not very clear.

Any help is appreciated!

3027,6 unit NYC rent controlled deal structure. give me feedback please!,,"There's a 6 unit rent controlled property in Brooklyn I found for $1.6M. Here are my thoughts on a plan:

1) equity loan on my home for 20% down (it would be less than the total value of my home) 
2) conventional loan for the remaining 80%
3) pay both loans in tandem (unless there's a way to only pay 1 at a time?) through cash I have saved up for a year plus tenant rent until I can refinance into 1 loan. Ideally during that 1 year I will do a value add and cash out refi for BRRRR to repeat this again. 

Rent control in NYC is strict and I think that's why it's only $1.6m for a 6 unit. You may say I'm better off taking that amount and using it outside the city, but I live in the nyc and it's a unit in an amazing neighborhood with a lot of long term growth potential. $1.6m for 6 units is not super common here at least from my searching over the last few years. 

Please let me know if you think it's a bad idea to get involved with rent control tenants, having two loans in tandem, starting my first rental property at a 6 unit $1.5m spot, using home equity loan, or any other issues you may see with this plan.

Passive income is income that can be earned automatically with minimal labor to earn or maintain. It is called progressive passive income when the earner expends little effort to grow the income. Examples of passive income include rental income and any business activities in which the earner does not materially participate. Some jurisdictions' taxing authorities, such as the Internal Revenue Service in the United States of America, distinguish passive income from other forms of income, such as earnings from regular or contractual employment, and may tax it differently.",u0nyj3,0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u0nyj3/trying_to_build_up_streams_to_replace_9_to_5_life/

3038,vanEck analysis: Gold & BTC potentially undervalued dramatically,,"Came accross this article of vanEck, performing analysis on Gold and BTC as reserve assets. 

[https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/emerging-markets-bonds/how-one-bond-manager-values-gold-and-bitcoin/](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/emerging-markets-bonds/how-one-bond-manager-values-gold-and-bitcoin/)

The analysis suggests that gold is heavily undervalued if it were to become the main reserve asset. Central banks hold relatively little gold, which means they would have to buy massive amounts of gold to back/stabilize their currency in case of a financial crisis. They made a similar analysis for BTC. However, I think the analysis for gold is more realistic as I am not so sure countries will massively start adopting BTC right now. 

Even if the price of gold and BTC reach 10% of the mentioned targets, they would turn a nice profit.

However, when you look online at businesses for sale, they are typically valued at 1x revenues and sometimes even cash flows.

Obviously, they are more riskier and timelier. They require paying employees and maintaining operations. In general, private businesses for sale seem to produce way better returns than investing in a public company. I presume this is what Buffett meant when he said that if he was investing small sums of money that he would produce way higher returns.

Why aren't more people doing this? Are these businesses too good to be true?

3048,Amazon vs. Tesla - what are your thoughts?,," Over the past 5 quarters, Amazon’s operating income has been getting decimated by inflation. The share price has been range bound for the past two years. Meanwhile, Tesla’s operating income has exploded. They’ve been range bound while their PE has compressed from over 1000 down to 180. In other words, through their impeccable execution, they’ve delivered unbelievable margins while continuing to scale. Amazon and Tesla are two companies that have been range bound for roughly the same duration. That sometimes means they’re about to make a swing in either direction. I’d put a spread trade on the two (Tesla up and amazon down) for the following reason: Tesla’s operating income has exploded sequentially for the past 5 quarters while amazons has done the exact opposite. I also think amazon is going to take a -$9 eps hit in Q1 driven by rivian and continued operating expense inflation. In Q1 ‘21 amazon hit $16 eps. That means their PE ratio is set to sky rocket with limited upside growth on top line revenue. Tesla on the other hand is just starting this journey. They built the infrastructure during a period pre-inflation and are flooded with cash. In an inflationary environment, you want/need improving margins.

3051,The simplest investing strategy I use,,"We've all heard the phrase that time in the markets, beats timing the markets. But what if I told you that's it's possible to actually do both. Be in the markets 100% of the time while also being able to attempt to time big sell offs and rallies.

This strategy relies on keeping money in the simplest low cost index funds, vanguard is a very great option but not the only one. I'll explain the concept first then how I apply it to my portfolio.

The concept, is to use simple ratios to decide what major index is performing best. On trading view you can make a ratio by charting either an etf or the index, whatever you chose to use just he consistent. So you do up charts that look like Sp500/Nasdaq100 or sp500/dow30. I then add a 365 day sma to the chart.

This line simply tells us, given the past 1 year of price action what index is outperforming the other? If our candles are above the sma, it shows strength in the index kn the numerator. If it's below the sma it's showing strength in the index in the denominator. The sma acts as a switch so to speak. 

We can go further with this. When you've analyzed these ratios you'll see the sp500 is dominant right now. So let's go further. Sp500/sp500 value. And sp500/sp500 growth. And sp500value/sp500 growth.

If you chart these ratios you'll see sp500 value is currently performing the very best, relative to all the other indices.

So what do we do with this information? I personally use it for my 401k. 10% bonds, 10% global, and 80% us stocks. So I take my calculation I've made and allocate that to my 80% us sp500 value stocks. Until a month ago, I was sp500 growth stocks. 

As you can see with this strategy, I've never exited the market but I have picked certain times when I want to switch which index will give me better returns.

Cheers 😘 

And I can provide the exact tickers I use if interested. But I picked my CRSP indexes because they are what vanguard uses exactly to balance their index funds, it could be different for you",ti2ur2,0,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ti2ur2/the_simplest_investing_strategy_i_use/

3062,"A ""recession shock"" is coming warning announced",," 4/8/2022

*I hope we are in not as bad shape.     If it arrives early at least we are prepared.*   

 This is from Research Strategist at BOA

The macro-economic picture is deteriorating fast and ""*COULD*"" push the U.S. economy into ***recession as the Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy to tame surging inflation***, BofA strategists warned in a weekly research note.

""'**Inflation shock**' worsening, 'rates shock' just beginning, 'recession shock' coming"", BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note to clients, adding that in this context, 

C**ash, volatility, commodities and crypto currencies could outperform bonds and stocks.**

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday signalled it will likely start culling assets from its $9 trillion balance sheet at its meeting in early May and will do so at nearly twice the pace it did in its previous ""quantitative tightening"" exercise as it confronts inflation running at a four-decade high. [**read more**](https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-qt-plan-then-now-2022-04-06/)

**A large majority of investors also expect the central bank to hike its key interest rate by 50 basis point**.

In terms of notable weekly flows, BofA said emerging market equity funds enjoyed the biggest inflow in ten weeks at $5.3 billion in the week to Wednesday while emerging market debt vehicles attracted $2.2 billion, their best week since September.

It was also an eight week of outflows for European equities at $1.6 billion while U.S. stocks enjoyed their second week of inflows, adding $1.5 billion in the week to Wednesday.

The analysis was based on EPFR data.

3063,There’s no reason to invest in VXUS / international etfs anymore given how tight the world market is to the US,,"I don’t understand the argument for having international exposure anymore. The United States rules the world, financially speaking. If the US goes belly up, so does Europe, Australia, and East Asia. China and Russia aren’t reliable. Africa, the Middle East, and South America are consistently unstable, and Europe is over regulated to death.

The only place at the current time that is stable enough and innovative enough to be worthy of investing in is the US. I don’t see the point of VXUS at all.",tt2zw2,0,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tt2zw2/theres_no_reason_to_invest_in_vxus_international/

3066,Doordash has the best app. It will continue to take share,,"Doordash is on a tear. It is crushing Eats/Postmates share. Their apps simply aren't good. If they can't hold onto demand, supply will falter.

This space is more differentiated than rideshare, where the service is a larger part, and the app matters less. For rideshare, you need to select 2 locations. For food, there is order and variant complexity. No one can handle this like Doordash.

I experienced the same thing with iFood and Rappi in Brazil. Would be very worried about iFood losing all of it's share to a superior app. Rappi is executing better at everything— 15 minute delivery, market, pharmacy, alcohol. As Doordash takes core share, it can expand into more verticals in more categories, as other platforms struggle to get off the ground.

Long $DASH.

3068,"How long will the correction of the crypto market last- my opinion, amateur",,"What are your expectations of the market? I am in a bitcoin short trade from $41,460 with 5x leverage and one of my three limit orders has already triggered at $40,770 and closed 30% of deal. At this point, I am looking at a strong magnet in the $37,140-$34,400 range for bitcoin.

All my deals I open on DEXs like Pangolin, Mimo, WOWswap. For trading with leverage (more often short deals on BTC) i use WOWswap.

A correction is needed to pump the market more volume. Let's look at the facts, bitcoin can't get above the $44,000 level for over a month, and the local low keeps breaking new marks. Obviously, the squeeze is coming soon, but up or down is not for us to decide. But for growth it is always necessary to gather something from weak hands, we all know it. This is my brief and general explanation of why I am in a bitcoin short deal. I am more than confident in my strategy.",tg59k4,0,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tg59k4/how_long_will_the_correction_of_the_crypto_market/
3069,Taking out a personal loan to invest into S&P 500,,"&#x200B;

Hello everyone,

I have a serious question, someone from my bank contacted me about personal loans and they're giving them out at 6.5% Interest, for the sake of the question lets assume I take out a 20k loan at 6.5% for 5 years, the repayment amount works up to 23,514 including bank commissions. Is it logical to take this 20k, invest it into S&P 500 for the 5 years? Assuming at 10% growth rate i'll have around 32k by the end of the 5 years with a profit of around 10k.

Do people actually do this? What are the downsides of a strategy like this? Other than the collapse of the stock market.",twrc49,0,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/twrc49/taking_out_a_personal_loan_to_invest_into_sp_500/

3072,The best companies to buy in this market,,"The best companies to buy in this market are companies that have high intrinsic value, are making good profit, and are at good value (on a p.e basis). Companies that have these traits will offer good long term returns and are much less susceptible to market sentiment. Because at the end of the day if you buy companies that are making good profit, and at good value on a p.e. basis, you'll get shareholder returns through dividends, potential acquisitions, and especially share buybacks. These companies offer the best risk/reward adjusted returns. Here are some examples:

1. Intel. Chips are much needed right now, clearly high intrinsic value. They make 5b each quarter in profit, and are trading lower than 10 p.e.

2. Facebook. Advertising is needed for companies to advertise their products and services. Clearly high intrinsic value. They make huge profit and are trading at a 14 pe.

3. Moderna. Vacines and medical treatments are needed, clearly high intrinsic value. They made 5b in profit last quarter and are trading at 3 p.e. Market hugely overestimates revenue depreciation.

4. Crescent Point Energy. Oil, natural gas, and energy are needed. Clearly high intrinsic value. High oil prices reflect this. They make good profit and are trading at 4 p.e.

5. Google. Advertising is needed for companies to advertise their products and services. High intrinsic value. They make a lot of profit and are trading at like an 18 p.e.

Here are examples of companies that are BAD buys in this market. Fubo, Square, Roblox, Skillz, PTON. Why take the risk and invest in speculative companies like this. Intel, facebook and the others are significantly less risky, and offer just as much upside. They are much better risk/reward options.
