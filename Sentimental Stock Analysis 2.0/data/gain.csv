87,2772,Anyone else extremely bullish on Denny's??,Discussion,"Hello all,

Long time reader, first time poster. Recently started investing in high growth, speculative companies like Amazon and Google. So now I thought I should diversify and invest in some high growth Consumer Discretionary plays and I stumbled upon this little gem. With a P/E ratio of less than 12, ***4% cash on hand***, and a YoY Revenue growth of 37.97%, it seems like a sure thing. In fact, I recently heard someone say that there is ""more business on the outside of Denny's than the inside."" That got me truly excited as it illustrates the extreme potential they have in serving this adjacent, untapped market segment. This seems like an easy ten bagger at these levels. I am thinking about not just starting a position but going all in. Thoughts, agree? Any insight would be much appreciated.

182,2086,NIU Technologies (NIU) Overview,Company Analysis,"**NIU Technologies (NIU)** \- the world’s leading provider of smart urban mobility solutions.

Founded in 2014. NIU designs, manufactures and sells high-performance electric scooters, motorcycles, bicycles and kick-scooters.

*Demand*: Scooters are a very convenient means of traveling. Anyone who has been to SE Asia has definitely noticed that the place is packed with scooters. These scooters start to be replaced with electric ones. Scooters are also popular in other regions of the world, notably Latin America, Europe and Africa.  

*Supply*: The company has doubled its production capacity last year. And now it's about 2 mln units/year. NIU has developed a rich network of stores around the world (3108 in China alone).  
NIU has several competitors, but has a few advantages over them. Mainly it benefits from lower labor costs.  


**Financials**

For a young company, NIU has a strong balance sheet. Positive Net Income and Cash Flow. The company does not need to issue new shares to finance its CAPEX.   
It benefits from access to cheap funding as China has been easing its monetary policy. They can afford to do that as the latest inflation figure was 0.9% in China.

In 2021 revenues were up almost 52%. At about $581mln, slightly more than the current Market Cap (P/S ratio > 1, rare thing).

Nevertheless, the price went down during the latest few months because of all-out war concerns but also because Q4 & Q1 are traditionally soft quarters, due to weather. Gross margin slightly lower reflecting higher commodity and shipping costs. Which are expected to fall onward. 

This year the sales are estimated to go up roughly 40%.   


**Valuation**

52 week high of $44/share, low of $7.50.  

All the analysts polled by Yahoo Finance, have a BUY/STRONG BUY stance. 

The average PT is $36.

Latest coverage, comes from Citigroup, it placed a price target of $35, which implies a roughly 300% upside potential.

Why I’m hesitant at first glance:

* trading near all-time highs
* P/E ratio of 76

In case you’re unfamiliar with them, here’s a snippet from their website:

“MP Materials helps fuel the electrification of global infrastructure. We are the largest producer of rare earth materials in the Western Hemisphere, through our state-of-the-art, zero-discharge operations in Mountain Pass, California. We currently deliver approximately 15% of global rare earth supply with a long term focus on Neodymium-Praseodymium (NdPr), a crucial input to the powering of electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones, robots and many other advanced technologies.”

And some a few reasons they’re making waves:

* YoY revenue and net income growth were easily in the triple digits for each quarter of 2021
* In February, the DoD signed a contract with MP for $35 million, trying to reinforce America’s supply chain of precious metals.
* In December, GM signed a long-term deal with MP for supplying materials, alloys, and magnets for its EV lineups.

# KEY POINTS

* SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory
* Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside
* MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy
* Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside)

# Company Description

Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues.

# Thesis

SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations.

This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4!

I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis:

This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering).

What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good.

More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no.

In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher.

Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). For now just know shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185.

Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace.

Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3

# Current Valuation & Financials

Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x

Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22

* Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value.

Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x

Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22

* These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth.
* This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP \[in PCIe Gen 5\] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs.
* Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed.

EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22

* You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product)

Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22

* Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept!
* Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21

Analyst Price Target: $110

* Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120.

# Technicals & Market Mechanics

SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. (See Appendix for charts)

SIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

# Upcoming Catalysts

Once again, a long list of event catalysts around the corner.

SIMO

* 3/23 Bank of America APAC TMT Conference 2022 (SIMO; potential pre-guide and/or capacity updates)
* 5/5 SIMO ER
* Now - 4/5, 5/6 - SIMO has expressed desire to accelerate their buyback program. Outside of the 30day pre-earnings blackout period, buybacks should kick in big time

Industry

* 3/23 U.S. Senate hearing on semis supply chain ""Developing Next Gen Tech for Innovation"", featuring execs from MU (25% revs) & INTC ($8.65% revs). Discussions will revolve around investment in Federal investment in semi mfg supply chains & America COMPETES Act 2022 & CHIPS for America Fund (potential $52bil to support US semi mfg fabs).

Key Supply Chain Ers (\~50% of Revs represented)

* 3/29 MU (25% Revs); this is THE biggest catalyst for SIMO, and thanks to current memory market dynamics, MU should have a total blowout
* 4/7 Samsung (3.3% Revs)
* 4/28 INTC (8.65% Revs)
* 4/28 Fujitsu (1.2% Revs)
* 4/28 SK Hynix (4.89% Revs)
* 4/29 WDC (4.23% Revs)
* 5/6 Arrow Electronics (2.2% Revs)

Understand that supply chain issues and demand for semi conductors have been inflating semiconductor prices since covid period. With the current war and sanctions going on, material prices and supply chains are posing more problems and it feels like prices of semi conductors will increase further. But what about the sector itself? Do you think the sector would perform? What are your thoughts? 


The semiconductor industry has been booming and if you look at the sector, the amount of money pooled into this sector has been on the rise. There has not been much significant pullbacks unlike other sectors like biotech for example. I feel that this industry has already hit it’s peak for the year and all the market news about semiconductor shortage has already been priced in (good news for the industry), which then brings me to my future outlook for this sector being likely to face a pullback sooner or later (especially if supply issues eventually gets resolved in the coming months, year due to u know… supply and demand curve)",tw3q57,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tw3q57/how_do_you_guys_think_the_semiconductor_sector/,POSITIVE,0.9947236776351928
70,2516,My Case For Global Foundries ($GFS),Discussion,"I believe Global Foundries ($GFS) to be an underdiscussed and **undervalued** sleeping giant.

**Full disclosure, 10% of my portfolio is allocated to GFS**, and I will do my best to lay out my side of the argument and I am open to hearing others.

GFS is a major player is the ever growing semi-conductor market. I live locally and have personally witnessed the massive growth this company has seen. 

There is a growing demand for semi-conductors from not only the home and office computing aspect, but with national security/defense, electric vehicles, data centers, and more. Almost everything we use and will need to use in the future runs on these chips.

The U.S and Europe specifically have been put into this position where moving toward chip independence can no longer be placed on the back burner and must be prioritized. The U.S. Senate on 3/27 approved a bill to provide $52 billion in U.S. subsidies for semiconductor chips manufacturing

TSMC has been a large provider of chips for a variety of companies and countries however with the current geopolitical state with China and Russia it is becoming a less risk adverse play due to being located in Taiwan which leads me to Global Foundries.


Since we cant see the financials of the future lets see how they performed last year

**Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Highlights**

Record revenue of $1.85 billion, up 9% sequentially.
Record gross margin of 20.8% and adjusted gross margin of 21.5%.
Record operating margin of 5% and adjusted operating margin of 8%.
Net income margin of 2% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%.
Cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion.

**Full Year 2021 Highlights**
Revenue of $6.6 billion, up 36% year-over-year.
Record gross margin of 15% and adjusted gross margin of 16%.

GlobalFoundries chips are found inside smartphones, laptops, automobiles, VR systems, video game consoles, smart speakers, and are also used in artificial intelligence and 5G

Global Foundries has customers such as Ford, Qualcomm, MediaTek, NXP Semiconductors and Qorvo

and on March 7th GlobalFoundries announced it is delivering Next-Gen Silicon Photonics Solutions collaborating with industry leaders including Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc, Marvell and NVIDIA, along with breakthrough photonic leaders including Ayar Labs, Lightmatter, PsiQuantum, Ranovus and Xanadu, to deliver innovative, unique, feature-rich solutions to solve some of the biggest challenges facing data centers today.

As of today $GFS is trading at 62.18 and I believe in the next 6-12 months with the explosion of electric vehicles and sustained/increased demand with the expansion of fabs and projected revenue increases we will see a price estimate of $80 on average with a high of $100.

179,1985,"$NVT DD; a manufacturer benefitting from ""the electrification of everything""",Company Analysis,"Looked into NVT recently, so figured I'd share my quick DD with the community. As always, do your own research, this isn't personal advice, yada, yada, yada. 

[nVent Electric](https://investors.nvent.com/investor-relations/default.aspx) (NVT) is an electrical component manufacturer that owns brands like Caddy, Erico, Hoffman, Raychem, Schroff, and Tracer. If it protects and connects critical electronics and equipment, nVent probably makes it. 

The company divides its products into three segments: 

* **Enclosures**: metallic and non-metallic enclosures, cabinets, subracks, and backplanes.
* **Thermal Management:** heat tracing, floor heating, fire-rated and specialty wiring, sensing, and snow melting and de-icing solutions.
* **Elecrical & Fastening Solutions:** fastening solutions can range from bridle rings for cable management to clips for securing light fixtures to the ceiling.

Since the pandemic, nVent has steadily increased quarterly revenue and expects momentum to remain strong for the current year, even with supply chain challenges and inflation headwinds.  

Why? Because the company benefits from the broader electrification movement. Solar, data centers, data networking, automotive, oil & gas, infrastructure — these industries (and many more) all rely on electronics one way or another. nVent creates the oft-overlooked components that enable safety, constant up-time, and cost-efficiency. 

It helps to have a physical tie to the electrification of everything. Here are a few financial highlights:

* **Solid revenue growth.** 13% increase in revenue in FY21 relative to FY19; pandemic set the company back briefly. Management anticipates 6-10% growth in FY22. 
* **Prudent management of corporate costs.** SG&A is routinely 22-24% of sales. 
* **100%+ net income conversion to free cash flow.** (FCF of $334 million in FY21)
* **Decent forward P/E ratio based on FY22 expectations** (15.5, which is below the comparable average for electrical component makers of 20).

Compared to peers, there may be other opportunities with higher upside, such as WIRE and ATKR. (Based on yesterday's close numbers.)

46,1313,Best performing ETF investment strategies in the current market. This is what I'm doing,Discussion,"Well fellas, the current macro situation isn’t looking that great and my hard-earned portfolio is seeking sanctuary. Is the end of our great bull market fastly approaching? Are we about to witness the black swans of black swans (ww3)?  
I don't have the answers, but I find myself pondering on these very issues every goddamn’ day in recent times.

I’ve decided to take a more strategic approach to ETF allocations (Using [composer.trade](https://composer.trade)) and as it stands this is what’s working the best for me right now.

**Equity Index Rotation**

This is pretty much a classic 60/40 portfolio with a twist. This symphony looks at the 5-day cumulative return for the major US indices and selects the one with the best performance. The strategy rotates among the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the industrial-led Dow, and the balanced S&P 500.

**Defense**

What I like the most about this strategy is the minimum volatility, quality, and yield factors. Ideal if the current macroeconomic situation is to further deteriorate.

**Paired Switching Dow and Bonds**

This strategy switches from holding the Dow to short-term US government bonds if the Dow has a dip. Then back again to the Dow until the next dip.

43,1218,I'm looking for gold and silver mining stocks to buy.,Discussion,"I've recently been researching mining stocks and have come across a few that are quite interesting. I've already made investments in larger companies, but I'd like to broaden my horizons and invest in a few more.

[First Majestic](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AG/) \- The Ermitao Project and the San Dimas operation are two of their exploration projects in Mexico. They just purchased a stream of 50% of payable silver generated from the Springpole Gold Project in Ontario, Canada, from First Mining.

[Trillium Gold Mines](http://www.trilliumgold.com/) \-  a gold exploration firm based in Canada ’s Red Lake gold camp in northern Ontario. In terms of exploration, I think this company has a ton of potential. As gold continues its upward trek, the gold sector should benefit. Also, gold’s apparent negative correlation with the market as a whole indicates companies like Trillium are due for a significant reset. 

[Kirkland Lake Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KL/) (KL) is a Canadian company with mines in Australia. I believe they still have potential. I believe they will continue to grow, despite their recent development projects taking a detour. Their management has improved, and their revenue growth continues to accelerate.

They’ve increased there revenue by 3-4 million each year for the last 3 years. Fairly solid EPS growth. Some massive company’s such as Morgan Stanley are holders. Low P/E ratio and solid dividends.

For all of you who lost - you guys know what you were doing.

BUT this is for those who use funds that aren’t owned by themselves like the guy who blew away his child’s college fund.

Don’t be a fuckwit. Gamble away only on your own funds. Don’t rope others into potentially disastrous situations that nobody can afford and royally fuck them over. 

And my recommendation is applicable to all: it is extremely hard to walk away when you’re winning. But markets are all about timing. Be open-minded, flexible, and composed mentally and emotionally. The goal is to make money, not lose it all.

**Paired Switching S&P 500 and Gold**

A pair of classics: stocks and gold. Together, but apart. This strategy switches between holding stocks and gold depending on their 90-day performance. It holds stocks if stocks are doing better, and gold if gold is doing better.

111,2429,$D - Complete Technical Analysis & Play Setup - Clean Weekly Chart Breakout,Technical Analysis,"A lot of people forget boomer stuff like utilities exists - and I'm here for it. Often times the most neglected stocks see the cleanest movement. Anyhow, $D (Dominion Energy) had a fantastic chart breakout two weeks ago and has been getting going.

[$D - 3Y Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/43l2ald7dup81.png?width=2241&format=png&auto=webp&s=94c74254dd1a9f3266d7db65af7845c304d5566f)

You can see here we broke a long-term trendline connecting the February 2020 highs to the November 2020 highs. We also broke out of a broadening descending wedge that formed during 2021. Normally I look for at least three reactions to any trendline I am playing, or setup - but in this case there were two setups, so I decided to take the play.

I also noticed $XLU - an ETF this stock belongs to that encompasses it's sector - was also breaking out. When analyzing or swing trading any stocks, I always make sure it's respective sector ETF agrees with the move. This adds some confluence.

[$XLU - 1Y Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/qli5me6wdup81.png?width=2241&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc1ebaef6b73faaea2d00cdf88736f76eec1eb2d)

As you can see - this too had a pretty clean breakout from multiple patterns. One was a descending channel, and another was a bullish pennant. The third one you see that is cut off is a longer-term ascending wedge we have been chopping around for some time.

[$XLU - 3Y Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ze1ma0u4eup81.png?width=2241&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5e394c7991efbecf71f9aae552eb73f690028b6)

It doesn't have a terribly large amount of confluence, but it agrees with everything else. These data points combined were enough for me to take a full size position in $D stock.

**Plan for the $D Setup -**

* I have a position in stock @ 80.91.
* I am planning on taking 1/2 off for +4.09 points at 85.00 - there aren't many levels to work with up in this range and this is likely psychological resistance. I am happy with my profits here.
* I would like to take the rest of the position off at 90.00.
* If we close back under 81.21 for a weekly candle, I will trail out of whatever I am in and consider the play dead.

Obviously I am posting this well into the play - but there is a chance this back tests at some point in the near future and grants another entry, utilities can be choppy. Also, I don't recommend blindly jumping into random internet stranger's stock plays. My aim here is more to show some pretty charts and educate.",tpb80n,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tpb80n/d_complete_technical_analysis_play_setup_clean/,POSITIVE,0.97211492061615

**What?**

Think interior plastic decorative parts for cars, components for a patient table, micro motors for heart implants, water fabrication equipment for semiconductors, components for industrial automation, and so on. 

They operate 18 sites with about 4.000 employees in Europe, Asia and the US, and serve customers in more than 50 countries. Google reviews of their sites in Europe by employees are positive.

**Magic numbers in Singapore Dollars (S$)**

 In FY2021, the Group’s revenue increased 23.6% year-on-year (yoy) to reach a record S$767 million. The Mechatronics Division posted a 26.6% increase in revenue to S$659.0 million due to the growth of the semiconductor segment.  Revenue at the IMS Division increased 6.8% to S$107.8 million because demand from automotive customers was constrained during the second half of the year due to semiconductor chip supply chain challenges.

*  Shareholders’ equity increased to S$376.2 million, which is equivalent to a net asset value of 88 cents per share (current share price of S$1.55 is assets minus debts x 2)
* S$688M assets and S$309M liabilities
* Revenue up from 2019, discounting 2020, by 16%
* Profit up from 2019, discounting 2020, by 22%
* EPS up from 2019, discounting 2020, by 38%
* PE of 11
* Net profit on turnover is 7.7%

They acquired Avimac which already has an established customer base, certified manufacturing facilities and programs in the commercial aerospace engineering industry and cooperation with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. They acquired a controlling equity interest in Penchem Technologies that produces polymer materials.

**So?**

It is down from its ATH since Nov 21, so it could be a good recovery play in the semiconductor/automotive industry, and a good play for industrial automation, away from the overvalued US market.

4-5-22 Daily TA

Writing this from my new computer which I am very excited that it is finally fully setup and running like a champ! Cant wait to test it intraday tomorrow as my macbook air was struggling for sure with everything I had running at one time. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bnq3b0zn9tr81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b02799037a22e01e92ac6bc24b2e160c3a5e6b7f

Intraday today despite a morning start that looked initially to be bullish the bears were able to get control of the day. Of course, this was at the assistance of fed member Brainard who dropped the bomb about balance sheet reductions and the expedited timeline for the fed. This set the market in to quite the tizzy seeing a massive 0.5% sell off within 30 minutes of news dropping. Initially it looked like we may recover after a clear market over-reaction… thinking back to the Saudi oil field attack we had last week. However, after a small pop from the low of 453.8 to 455.5, the bears took back control and took SPY for an impressively bearish close below some key supports for a -1.25% close. 

The one thing I will be considering going into tomorrow if the markets took the opportunity to price in the FOMC minutes tomorrow and that the markets are assuming that JPOW had said and will be more hawkish than anticipated. However, it would not be surprising to see the markets react bullishly tomorrow morning before seeing a massive sell off once minutes drop. Historically thinking back that is how the last few FOMC meetings have gone. 

SPY today closed below a key “ level” of support of 452 today. The next support level is down near 448. It was quite the fight at 452.5 all day but I believe now that we broke below this support we may start seeing some more downside. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yk75xkqo9tr81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=49bb2a19c2ef846e20678553a7c5f144fd6f1715

The daily chart for spy is quite bearish now. Looking back to March 29th we formed what I am calling the upper resistance at 462 and now we just may retest support down near 410 over the next month. Also today was the first candle closed BELOW the daily 8ema since March 15th. The bears tried very hard last week to close below but the bulls wouldn’t let it happen. In general a close below the daily 8ema is a bearish omen in the markets. We also broke the grey upward channel today officially. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xq7aqncp9tr81.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7ea15f97ff3547decb675898ef34749553d0843

The weekly chart is currently set up with another doji but any downward momentum from her will make it a true bear candle. The weekly 20ema and 8ema is still down near 445-446 which could be the target for the bears this week (that is also major supports on the daily chart).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hxib901q9tr81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee2cfe880a44995b24094c2d0a29d925d6ab342f

Apple despite a bearish day tested the support of its channel and it is too close to tell yet on the daily chart if its broke it officially. It did manage to close above its daily 8ema at 174.83 which is a more bullish close for Apple after a -1.89% day. 

But as you can see on both SPY and Apples daily chart their daily MACDs are ready to curl to sell signal and the RSI is looking bearish both near 58 and trailing downward now. 

&#x200B;

The VIX had yet another wild day. Opening at 18.55 before climbing all the way to 21.57 before market close. That is another massive day, at 16% run up from low to high is wild for VIX! Again the VIX though was the guide of the market. Despite the expect over-reaction and mid day bullish reversal once the vix continued its slow climb up we knew that was not going to happen. 

Historically 16.5 to 21.5 over the last year or so has been the average VIX Range so we are not at the upper level of that. A VIX back over 22 would be quite bearish also and could allow for some increased volatility that we surely have been lacking. 

I will be gone in the morning with some personal stuff so I am going to include all premarket levels to watch here as I will not have time to post in the morning. I will be back on the server for live chat hopefully by 12 at the latest. 

Support- 

450.9 -> 450.45 à 449.7 à 449.1 à 448.4 à 447.21 (break support of next “level”) 

\-0.5%= 448.7

\-1%= 446.5

\-1.5%= 444.3

\-2%= 442

I would watch for a break of 450 cleanly followed by the break to 447.2. If we can break and hold there a close near the daily 20,50 and 100 ema all near 444-446 is 100% possible. 

Resistance- 

451.5 à 452.2 (break back above next “level” up) à 452.7(major support intraday today) à 453.4 à 454

0.5%= 453.3

1%= 455.5

1.5%= 457.8

2%= 460

Bulls will need a clean gap above 452 resistance that holds, good FOMC news and they could very well see 455 to 457 end of day with a run up near 460-465 to end the week.",txaisl,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/txaisl/4522_spy_daily_ta/,POSITIVE,0.8658861517906189

178,1977,[DD] My personal top 3 solar stocks right now,Company Analysis,"Solar stocks had a rocky year in 2021. Overall, the solar stocks market ended the year with a loss of 27% following a jump of almost 240% in 2020. Over the last few weeks, I've been researching the top solar stocks to buy in 2022 and I've found three that I think are a really, really good pick.

# Canadian Solar (CSIQ)

The name probably makes it obvious that this is a Canadian company which specialises in solar panel engineering, production and construction. Founded in 2001, Canadian Solar has grown steadily over the years. In fact, they have one of the biggest solar panel manufacturing capability in the world right now. They are vertically integrated and produce everything from ingots and wafers to cells and complete solar modules. Currently, they have a module production capacity of 22.1 gigawatts and that is expected to increase to 32 gigawatts by the end of 2022. However, you should know that all of their manufacturing is based in China so they can be a bit vulnerable if US-China relations become worse. Still, one trend that is visible in the solar industry is that the top 5 manufacturers are getting more and more market share and Canadian Solar is in the top 5! The other really great thing about Canadian Solar is their focus on battery storage projects. Solar-and-storage projects is what is currently driving the solar industry. These projects include both solar panels and the batteries necessary to store the energy output of those panels. Canadian Solar currently has roughly 21 gigawatts hours worth of battery projects across the world in their construction phase or just in the backlog. Plus, Canadian Solar have a total of 24 gigawatts peak of solar projects around the world, spread between North America, Latin America, Europe and the Middle East, China and the Asia-Pacific region.

One of the best things with Canadian Solar is that their projects are worldwide so they are relatively protected from specific geopolitical tensions although that also means that shipping costs are a big factor with the company. In fact, shipping costs and rising commodities costs is what drove Canadian Solar down in 2021. Key materials went up between 120% and 338% while shipping costs went up 159% during 2021 resulting in overall module manufacturing costs going up by more than 40%! This exposed one of Canadian Solar's weaknesses which is its low profit margin which makes it especially vulnerable to rising prices. However, this also means that Canadian Solar will benefit a lot more from stabilising or falling prices. If we see that, Canadian Solar could shoot up in price. Also, part of Canadian Solar's strategy is to keep parts of its solar projects and sell the power instead of selling the whole farm. That way, the company will have some steady income to balance out its earnings, which is really great and will make them much more financially resilient! Right now, the solar stock trades with a PE ratio of 29.3 and a forward PE ratio of 7.51! Their price-to-earnings-growth ratio is also just 0.6 which is extremely good value! Canadian Solar does have a lot of debt, roughly $2.2 billion dollars which comes up to a debt-to-equity ratio of 107.4%, but it also has a cash pile of $867 million so their financial situation is relatively stable. In my opinion, Canadian Solar is one of the top solar stocks to buy right now although you need to keep in mind that this solar stock is volatile and is correlated to shipping and materials costs so you need to keep an eye on them.

# First Solar (FSLR)

Unlike Canadian Solar, First Solar is an American company with American-based manufacturing (Americaaa, fuck yeaaah!). In fact, that is one of its main competitive advantages over companies like Canadian Solar. First Solar is less susceptible to hikes in shipping prices although the majority of materials necessary for solar panel production do come from China so First Solar does have some exposure to that. The other competitive advantage that First Solar has is the type of solar panels that it produces. First Solar produces solar panels that are better suited for utility-scale solar farms. Their solar panels are also more resistant to weather and have a better production consistency although their maximum efficiency is slightly lower than the panels of competitors like Canadian Solar and Jinko Solar. Still, this makes First Solar a very competitive choice for large-scale solar projects, especially US-based projects. Similar to Canadian Solar, First Solar has a lot of projects in the backlog with a 26.2 gigawatts worth of solar module shipments backlog as of now. With a current manufacturing capacity of 8.4 gigawatts, First Solar has enough projects for the next 3 years! Still, the company is expanding their manufacturing with new factories in India and the US and should reach a production of 15.8 gigawatts by the end of 2024. This does highlight a potential problem though. If First Solar is not able to keep up with the demand, they could start losing business to companies like Canadian Solar which have a much higher production capacity. To me, it seems like First Solar is trying to do a controlled expansion, which is good for their finances, but it can cost them their leadership in the market.

Still, First Solar is one of the most profitable companies in the sector precisely because of their approach. In fact, First Solar had a profit margin of 16% in 2021 and currently have a PE of just 15.9. However, they are anticipating reduced earnings in 2022 due to their expansion plans, but we are expecting to see a jump in EPS in 2023. Their forward PE for 2022 is only 29.15 although that is based on an estimated EPS of $0.41 dollars. The company's guidance for 2022 is an EPS between $0 and $0.6 dollars so their forward PE will probably be very volatile. This is also why I think First Solar may see another dip before the end of the year if they keep seeing increased costs. On the other hand, lower costs will be very beneficial for the stock price. Basically, you are taking a bit of a risk here with material costs. If you think that they will go up, then maybe wait out. If you think they will go down, then First Solar is a good pick. Overall, I think the company will do really well in the next 3 to 5 years. They are a leader in the solar field, they have good operations, they have a net cash position of $1.6 billion dollars on a market cap of $8.1 billion. As long as they manage to keep up with demand and control their expenses, the stock price of First Solar will keep going up.

# Enphase Energy (ENPH)

Founded in 2006, Enphase Energy focuses on designing, developing, manufacturing and selling solar energy solutions in the US and internationally. Enphase Energy's main product is the microinverter which converts DC to AC energy at the solar panel so that the energy can actually be consumed by the end user. In addition, Enphase Energy offer a storage battery in two configurations, 10.1 kilowatt-hour and 3.4 kilowatt-hour. They also offer a portable energy system which is used off-grid and offers huge possibilities in the Indian market. They are also developing Electric Vehicle chargers and fuel cells which are two new, but rapidly growing markets. Overall, Enphase Energy is a leading pure-play solar company with a high-quality product offering and a massive addressable market. In terms of manufacturing, Enphase Energy's main operations are in Mexico and India which was a strategic move to avoid being affected by US and China trade relations and possible tariffs. I think that was a really smart play on their side and shows real foresight from the management. Most solar companies have operations in China because you get cheap labor and easy access to the necessary key materials, but obviously it brings other issues. Enphase Energy's CEO has actually shown really good business understanding and strategic thinking over the last few years and that is really, really important.

Now, unlike Canadian Solar and First Solar, Enphase Energy is actually classified as a growth company. Over the next few years, analysts are expecting an average of 32.9% earnings growth and 20.8% revenue growth which is much, much higher than the rest of the industry and higher than its closest competitor, SolarEdge. Enphase's management is also focused on their 35/20/15 business model which stands for a target of 35% gross margin, 20% operating income and 15% operating expenses. Currently, their operating expenses are a bit higher, standing at 24% overall for 2021 although they have dropped to 16.5% for the last quarter of 2021. However, their operating profit is also higher at 25.4% for 2021 so that's okay. Plus, their gross margin has been steadily improving and currently stands at 40.2%, 5% above their target. Still, that model shows Enphase Energy's long-term plan and it's good to see they have such a plan in place. This is also something that a lot of investors like. Everyone loves predictability when it comes to investing. Enphase Energy is also less affected by commodity price increases and shipping costs than Canadian Solar and First Solar so that's another positive for the company. Still, Enphase Energy is trading at a premium because of its expected growth. Their current PE is 150.7 with their forward PE for 2022 being 50 or 56.8, depending on your source. Their price-to-earnings-growth ratio is 1.41 which is actually a bit lower than the sector median of 1.44, but it's still relatively high. Enphase Energy also has a net debt of $20 million dollars which is tiny given that their market cap is $23.9 billion. Overall, I think that Enphase Energy is a solid bet for the next 3 to 5 years. However, the price is a bit steep right now and doesn't really offer a big margin of safety. Also, given the fact that we have multiple expected interest rate hikes this year, growth stocks like Enphase Energy are likely to be hit with a lower valuation. Basically, my personal opinion which is not financial advice is that I would only buy a small amount of this solar stock and I would look for opportunities to add to my position over this year. Again, I am very, very bullish on Enphase Energy, mainly because of their Indian solar market bet. There are not a lot of companies that are targeting it and it is massive so Enphase Energy have a huuge opportunity there. But, again, I would be wary of going all-in on Enphase right now.

Alright, so that's it, those are my 3 top solar stocks to buy or watch right now. What do you think? What are your favourites?",tfijf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tfijf5/dd_my_personal_top_3_solar_stocks_right_now/,POSITIVE,0.8008580803871155

167,2825,Buying a competitor after acquisition,Company Discussion,"On the surface, is there an advantage to purchasing stock in a competitor of an acquisition, or was the competitor purchased because it was the better option? 

I understand that each situation is unique and complicated, just trying to get insight. Specifically with the LHCG acquisition by UNH. I own LHCG, been averaging down and will see a nice premium, but I am considering a position in AMED, which I see as pretty much a direct competitor with little difference.  I also own ADUS, which is in the same space but a little different. I own LHCG and not AMED due to internal issues with workforce at AMED that seem like temporary headwinds.

65,2405,Can the Australian market continue to outperform this quarter?,Discussion,"Apart from the FTSE, the ASX200 is the only major stock index that is higher YTD, as it managed to outperform during the opening quarter this year. 

Although this month’s rally, which saw the ASX break the key support-turned-resistance 200-day MA, was led by tech and consumer discretionary stocks as risk sentiment rebounded, it’s arguably the index’s composition that have helped it outperform, helping limit the decline in first two months of 2022.

While global markets where hit heavily by the prospect of higher interest rates and soaring commodity prices, the ASX200 was cushioned by its majority weighting in financial and commodity stocks. It won’t be surprising to see some profit-taking after such an aggressive move higher, but if the Aussie index can hold above its 200-day, it should help cement a new uptrend and put the record highs back in sight. 

However, this will likely depend on global risk sentiment, which still hangs in the balance as geopolitical tensions and concerns on overly aggressive central banks persist. Not to mention, the local market may also see larger-scale profit taking and rebalancing as the end of this quarter coincides with the end of the Australian financial year, and a close back below the 200-day MA could put the ASX200 at risk of a deeper pullback in the near-term. 

All trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see whether the Aussie market can continue to outperform this quarter as well.",ttmqb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ttmqb9/can_the_australian_market_continue_to_outperform/,POSITIVE,0.6393511295318604
53,2078,Nvidia Investor Day - are expectations too high ?,Discussion,"Here are the main discussion points for Nvidia's investor day (and my expectations):

1. New chips: Hopper (data center), Bluefield data processing (DPU) and Grace (CPU). *EXPECT UPSIDE SURPRISE*
2. Data center addressable market update - previously highlighted as a $100bn opportunity. E*XPECT UPSIDE SURPRISE*
3. Software/subscription opportunity across enterprise AI, metaverse, autos and gaming; *POTENTIAL FOR DOWNSIDE SURPEISE AS STILL TOO EARLY FOR COMPANY TO PROVIDE DETAILS?*
4. Automotive pipeline details - previously $8bn - *TOO FAR OUT TO MATTER?*
5. Buybacks following no Arm deal. *MAY PROVIDE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION*

I think there is potential for upside from the data center side - new products and large data center opportunity. AI has really gained broad adoption beyond consumer use e.g. powering ""next gen"" cybersecurity solutions, companies are deploying AI based sales lead generation, procurement tools etc. This should be significant benefit for Nvidia and I think it is already in motion so they should be providing an update.

On the flip side I think its too early to provide concrete numbers re Omniverse, Nvidia's version of industrial metaverse, which may be a downside surprise for some investors.

169,1210,SoFi company analysis and valuation - Big story and many risks ($SOFI),Company Analysis,"SoFi has been a very popular retail stock and I underestimated the amount of information that was available for it. It took me quite some time to differentiate what is important and what isn't and this post is a summary of my findings and it includes valuation at the very end.

**What is SoFi?**

SoFi is a Fintech company that aspires to be a one-stop-shop for financial services, that allows members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money.

Now, the main question is, well, **how is this different than a bank?** The management provides 4 differentiation points:

1. Speed - being faster than the competitors when it comes to approval of loans, opening accounts, buying/selling stock through their platform, payments, etc. - In my opinion, although this industry has been around for hundreds of years, there's no doubt that certain parts of it have to be disrupted. However, my question is, assuming this is an advantage that SoFi has, is it sustainable for the next 5, 10, or 15 years? I don't think so.

2. Selection of products - More products related to borrowing, saving, investing, and protecting money. I personally don't buy this differentiation point. I do believe cost-cutting is possible, but coming up with something new and innovative that's significantly different than the current offerings, I doubt it.

3. Content - Financial education, research, insights - Even if SoFi has a platform that offers more financial education and research, this is something that is easily replicable. I don't see this as a huge long-term advantage.

4. Convenience - Instead of having opening times between 9 and 5 from Monday to Friday, they want to offer the services 24/7. The company has an only online presence so they can cut some costs as they don't have to lease buildings for this purpose.

&#x200B;

**The 3 segments**

The company has 3 segments and it is worth spending time understanding each one:

1. The lending segment - self-explanatory - accounts for 75% of the total revenue
2. The technology segment - which is related to Galileo - accounts for 19% of the total revenue
3. The financial services segment - is related to all the products such as debit/credit cards, budgeting tools, investing, etc. - accounts for 6% of the total revenue

All 3 sectors have been growing fast, but we need more information to understand the second one.

The technology segment is related to an acquisition the company made back in 2020 (Galileo) and the purchase price was roughly $1.2b. At the time, that was almost 15% of the company's market cap. What SoFi got from the acquisition was a payment processing platform that uses AI for fraud detection, which is more efficient than the industry average. On top of that, it has an API that allows for app development. The revenue for SoFi will come in the form of platform fees and program management fees. This is one of their big bets and the management refers to this segment as the AWS of Fintech. The same way a business can be started on Amazon within a day, well, that's what they're aiming for, except for companies in the financial industry.

&#x200B;

**The growth story, the metrics, and the confusion**

The company provides two key metrics for its growth in its annual report.

1. The # of users - This has significantly grown from 1m back in 2019, to almost 2m in 2020 to almost 3.5m in 2021. However, it is worth mentioning that every one that is registered on the platform is a member and remains one unless the terms of service are violated. So, if there's an inactive member for 3 years, it doesn't matter, that person will be considered a member. However, what I'm missing here is the revenue per user. Having users is good, but if they're not being monetized, the metric is useless.
2. The # of products - If the first metric is not that useful, maybe this one serves a better job. If you as a member have a personal loan, well, that's one product. If you have a credit card, that's another one. If you are using their platform to invest, that's another one. The idea of the company to build a good relationship with its members and sell many of its products is great. Well, the number of products reported in 2021 was 5m. That translates to roughly 1.5 products per person. It did increase from 1.21 in 2019, but it isn't that impressive (yet). Although it sounds as if this could be a great metric, well, there's another trap here, not every product has the same value. 1m of these 5m products are related to the lending segment, which as mentioned above, accounts for 75% of the total revenue! The remaining 4m products bring in only 6% of the revenue as they're related to the financial services.

So, we have metrics that are not that reliable. What's next?

&#x200B;

**The company's performance and what can we expect?**

If we look at the company's performance, it is a money-losing company with a negative net margin of -48% for 2021 on its roughly $1b in revenue.

A **mature** company in this industry has:

\- a net margin that's between 10-15% 

\- high leverage (debt on the balance sheet being over 80% of the total passive)

\- RoE around 16%

Currently, the debt is around 50% of the balance sheet, so there's still a lot of room to grow.

These numbers should serve as a sanity check later on for my valuation as if I forecast anything that's significantly above that, it might be unreasonable.

&#x200B;

**What's next?**

The company made one large acquisition (Galileo) in 2020 for $1.2b. At the beginning of 2022, they announced the large acquisition of Technisys for $1.1b, which is a company that will serve as their core banking system. Both of these acquired companies have some presence in LATAM, so SoFi is acquiring new companies that have a presence in other geographical regions as well.

The analysts forecast about 50% revenue growth in 2022, followed by 41% revenue growth in 2023. Great growth, but slightly declining. At the same time, the net margin is expected to improve, from -48% in 2021, to :

\-21% in 2022

\-6% in 2023

\+5% in 2024

&#x200B;

**The risks**

Due to the actions being taken, there are two large risks that I see:

1. **Execution** risk - Their big bet (The technology segment), currently accounts for less than 20% of the revenue and hasn't yet proven as successful.
2. **Integration** risk - Combining SoFi with Galileo and Technisys might sound great and there's always the amazing word synergy being used, but that's yet to be seen in the financials. There's an integration risk here that needs to be addressed.

&#x200B;

**The valuation**

Taking into account all the information above, I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value.

**Revenue growth** \- 898% in the next 10 years (following analysts' estimates for the next 2 years, then slowly declining). From $1b in 2020 to $10b in 2030.

**Net margin** \- From -48% in 2021 to 13.5% in 2030 - Close to industry average

**Discount rate** \- 12.8% (Based on cost of equity)

**RoE** \- Based on the assumptions above and the development of equity, the RoE is roughly 15%, which is close to the industry's average.

&#x200B;

Putting all the numbers together, and adjusting for the equity options and the preferred shares, the value of the company is **$8.8b** (almost $8/share). The current market cap is $6.5b.

It is worth mentioning that at the moment, I am looking at SoFi as a company that's not significantly different than the current ones in this industry.  I am aware that I could be significantly wrong in my assumptions and if I see a better performance from their technology segment, my storyline would significantly change.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: Technicals for  $ G M E  stock  indicate a rising Relative Strength Index, a positive flip beginning with the Schaff Trend Cycle, and a double bottom clearly shown in the chart.  We have a visual rebound that is pure green over 5 days, with statistical outliers on the high end- showing that any gain in price has not yet taken hold.  Ortex data shows SI% maxed out for a historic 30 days in a row, a 138% increase in reported-only short-interest over a period of 4 months.  Options activity is on the rise again, with calls jumping ahead of puts in a 1.84:1 ratio.  Implied Volatility supports are rising with a shown historical discount in IV based on historical peaks (currently 0.95 versus 2.1) meaning call options are very discounted here but demand is beginning for them.  And finally, the 15 month price is $225.00 per share, which shows the stock is now at a 58.2% discount to the split-range.

168,611,"One year ago, I wrote a bear case for AMD. Let's review.",Company Analysis,"**About me:** I like to write about semiconductor companies and tech stocks. My previous analysis (examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stzcql/google_announces_privacy_changes_to_android_that/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ss5w5r/big_cloud_winner_will_be_based_on_who_can_make/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/)) have been upvoted to the top of /r/stocks or near the top. I noticed that Wallstreet tends to be very late on seeing future trends of chipmakers, which allowed me to make a decent profit. For example, it was only last week when Barclays downgraded AMD on competitive trends. I first warned about this exact same thing, in more detail around a year ago.

I also recommended Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, TSMC, Amazon over AMD. This recommendation has done well as they've collectively been much better than AMD. I believe these companies will continue to beat AMD over the long run. By long run, I mean next 3 years.

Note that I rode AMD from $12 to around $80. Then I switched out to the above companies based on the thesis below. It has done extremely well for me.

**Original post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is\_amd\_the\_king\_of\_the\_titanic\_x86/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is_amd_the_king_of_the_titanic_x86/)

The basic premise was that the computing industry as a whole is moving away from a duopoly (often monopoly) of Intel and AMD. x86 chips (which is what AMD and Intel make) are being replaced at a rapid rate on servers, and Apple Silicon jump-started the switch at the laptop and desktop level.

AMD was fortunate enough to catch Intel's pants down and it was fortunate enough to be making GPUs during the crypto boom.

But when the dust settles, AMD's future looks bleak.

Let's review some of my predictions below with comments in **bold**.

\---------

Most people here focus on AMD vs Intel or AMD vs Nvidia like it's still 2010.

In 2021, it's AMD vs Intel, Nvidia, ARM, Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Ampere, Nuvia.

It's tough to see an exponential trend when you're at the beginning. This post spells out the trends for all AMD markets.

**ARM Attack on consumer x86 market:**

* x86 market shrank by 10% the moment Apple announced a full transition to ARM **True. Apple Silicon is both faster, and far more efficient than AMD's very best chips today. Apple's Macs are growing extremely fast as a result.**
* Even worse, Apple is the forcing function for PC software makers to [support ARM](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/), paving the way for Windows ARM **True. A ton of software makers have developed ARM versions in the last 2 years.**
* Microsoft has just announced [x86 emulation on their Windows ARM OS](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) **Windows 11 ARM can now emulate x86 apps. Paving the way for ARM CPU makers on Windows.**
* Apple's entry-level [M1](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2020) is faster than [4900HS](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-9-4900hs) by 55% in single-core and 3.7% in multi-core while using 5x less power. You can buy an M1 laptop today while the 4900HS is a highly binned-part.
* Apple's entry-level iGPU blows away the very best AMD iGPU
* Apple's ARM chip allows the entry-level Macbook Pro to have 20 hours of battery life while staying extremely cool
* Apple is readying [8,16, 32 core SoCs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs). For reference, M1 has only 4-high performance cores.
* Apple is poised to [significantly increase PC market-share](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/), 100% within 3 years. **On pace.**
* In order to compete, PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP will increasingly look to ARM alternatives
* Microsoft is working on in-house ARM chips for Surface **Yes. They hired Apple ARM architect. They're planning ARM chips for Azure as well.**
* Qualcomm is expected to become [a serious player](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020) in the laptop space **Yes. They bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion to focus on laptops (as the first market).**

**ARM Attack on hyperscalers market:**

* AWS's Graviton2 workload increased by 10x last year. In just one year, Graviton2 is now [10% of all AWS CPU](https://twitter.com/LucidCap/status/1338208878278926338) workloads. **In 2020, Graviton2 accounted for 50% of all new EC2 instances. It's likely much more in 2022. Amazon just announced Graviton3.**
* Like Apple in consumer market, Amazon is the forcing function for better ARM server software support **Yes. Almost all popular server software now have ARM versions.**
* Amazon will most certainly prioritize in-house designs over x86 chips. In the future, Amazon will likely offer x86 only for legacy software. **Looking like it. Look up Graviton3. Amazon is all in.**
* AWS controls 40% of the cloud. If AWS moves most of its future workload to its own CPUs, then AMD can control at best 60% of what Intel used to contol.
* In house ARM chips allow hyperscalers to differentiate, save on cost, and build chips tailored to their unique challenges
* Microsoft is designing its own ARM cloud chips **Yes**
* You can expect Google, Baidu, Tencent to follow soon **Yes. Alibaba, Tencent both launched custom ARM chips for their clouds. Baidu will soon as well. Google has signaled that they will be developing custom ARM chips for their cloud.**
* Hyperscalers don't want to be controlled by a duopoly. If Intel isn't grabbing them by the balls, then it's just AMD. It's the same thing. Hyperscalers want to control their own destiny and ARM allows them to.

**ARM Attack on small size cloud companies:**

* Ampere will allow smaller cloud companies to buy into ARM **If Ampere was a public company, I'd be buying a lot.**
* Anandtech just said that Ampere's latest 80-core chip is [42% better than Epyc](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review/9) in terms of cost/performance
* Ampere is releasing a 128-core chip in 2021
* Anandtech says Ampere's 2022 N1 Neoverse chip could be 50% faster at minimum
* Very well-funded startup Nuvia is also competing here **Bought by Qualcomm to bring ARM to Windows laptops**

**GPUs:**

* Apple will no longer use AMD GPUs in their computers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is testing [64-core and 128-core GPUs](https://videocardz.com/newz/apple-reportedly-developing-high-end-32-core-cpus-and-128-core-gpus). For reference, M1 has 8 GPU cores.
* Nvidia's grip on server GPUs and AI is tight and AMD has a mountain to climb in order to catchup
* With ARM, Nvidia can now offer complete server units from CPU to GPU to interconnects, just like AMD **Although the ARM deal fell through, Nvidia introduced their Grace CPU which they claim is faster than and more efficient than anything AMD offers.**
* Intel is joining the cloud GPU competition, and they're expected to use TSMC to manufacture Xe GPUs. **True**

**Consoles:**

* Mobile gaming is now [3x bigger than consoles](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/)
* Consoles are a low-margin business
* It's quite possible that PS5/Xbox Series X are the last consoles ever if AAA gaming moves to the cloud in the next 6-7 years

**TSMC:**

* As more companies move to in-house designs, competition for TSMC wafers are expected to increase significantly
* Apple is likely to continue to hold a node advantage lead because they have a lot more cash and a lot more volume. Apple's volume will likely increase significantly with Apple Silicon Macs. Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to sell 35 million Macs/year by 2023.
* Unlike Intel, AMD does not have a node advantage over Qualcomm, Ampere, Nuvia, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
* Intel is expected to [make a decision](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4067508) on whether they will invest in their 7nm process node in Spring of 2021 or use TSMC. If Intel decides to go fabless instead, AMD will lose its node advantage over Intel and wafer prices will increase for everyone. **Semi-true.** **Intel will use TSMC 3nm AND continue to develop their 7nm node (renamed to Intel 4). This means Intel will be competing with AMD for TSMC wafers and will continue to build out their own fab.**

**If you're buying into AMD long-term, you have to believe that:**

* AMD will become a monopoly in the x86 market in record time **Not going to happen. Intel's Alder Lake has the performance crown now and better architecture. While Zen4 will be better, Intel is incredibly aggressive with its roadmap.**
* Intel will not switch to TSMC and does not fix its node issues. Basically, you expect Intel to do nothing. **Intel's Alder Lake is a huge return to the performance crown.**
* AMD can make enough progress in Zen to delay the inevitable full ARM dominance
* AMD is working on ARM chips now, or will buy Ampere/Nuvia to enter the ARM race **Nuvia already bought by Qualcomm**
* Wall Street will respond well if AMD decides to go ARM and bet against their own cash cow: Epyc
* AMD can eventually compete with Nvidia in GPUs/AI
* AMD takes a big piece of the cloud gaming pie
* Consoles will have another generation after PS5/Xbox
* Microsoft, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Qualcomm, Nuvia, Nvidia, Intel fail to compete with Zen and Radeon

**My personal recommendation:**

* You can own AMD
* You're crazy if you're still all-in on AMD
* You should diversify your portfolio with TSMC, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia **This suggestion proved to be wise. AMD is getting downgraded while Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia continue to soar. Amazon is doing well. TSMC is ok.**",tv20la,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tv20la/one_year_ago_i_wrote_a_bear_case_for_amd_lets/,POSITIVE,0.5017784237861633
